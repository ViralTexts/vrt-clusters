ILLINOIS CAPITAL RULED BY RIOTERS  
Two Persons Killed, Many Injured, and Stores Wrecked After Lynching Is Foiled.  
NEGRO QUARTER IS BURNED.  
After Destroying White Restaurant Houses of Blacks Are Fired by the Crowd.  
  
Riot, arson and slaughter held pos- session of the black belt and levee of Springfield, Ill., all through Friday night. Two men were killed, nearly 100 wounded, the streets were full of militia, and rioters set fire to negro houses in all parts of the black belt.  
The fire department was intimidated and overawed by the rioters, and until the arrival of 1,000 additional State soldiers the authorities were practically helpless to control the situation.  
Mob Balked by Ruse.  
All this turmoil grows out of an at- tempt to lynch a negro who had at- tacked a white woman. The negro was spirited out of town, and the mob, balked in its vengeance, immediately turned on the man who loaned his auto- mobile to the authorities to enable them to convey the negro to a place of safe- ty. This was the spark that started the riot.  
Special trains were hurried from De- eatur, Jacksonville, Bloomington, Pe-oria, and half a dozen other towns, bearing infantry, cavalry and artillery.  
Early in the state of riot all the sa- loons and disorderly houses in the city were closed by the Mayor, and the mili- tiamen did their best to prevent the col- lecting of any crowds in the streets. Their efforts were futile, however. They would disperse a crowd in one neigh- borhood, and it immediately reassem- bled in another.  
When at 2 a.m. the burning of negro houses commenced the negroes retail-ated by shooting from the upper stories of the houses in the neighborhood where the torch was applied. A number of persons were hit during these fusillades and were carried away by their friends before their identity was discovered.  
  
Origin of the Trouble.  
The inciting cause of the trouble was an assault made on Friday on Mrs. Earl Hallam, wife of a street car con- ductor. Mrs. Hallam, whose husband works at night, was pulled from her bed at midnight by a negro, who then -dragged her into a garden in the rear of the house, where he assaulted her.  
This was the last straw on the minds of the whites of the city, the hatred against the blacks having been smolder- ing since a month ago, when Clergy A. Ballard was slain in his home by a negro, who, it is said, had entered the Ballard home in an attempt to assault Mr. Ballard&#x27;s young daughter.  
George Richardson, a negro, was ar- rested for the asasult upon Mrs. Hal- lam and placed in the city jail with Joseph James, who was accused of the Ballard murder.  
Mutterings of mob violence began soon after the Richardson identification by the woman, and a great crowd col- lected about the jail. After Richard- son had been identified by Mrs. Hallam the crowds grew even more violent, and it was decided to take the prisoner out of town.  
Sheriff Charles Werner made ar- rangements to take the men to Bloom- ington and the attention of the crowd around the jail was distracted by an alarm of fire while the men were placed in Harry T. Loper&#x27;s automobile and whisked away to the railroad station near the fair grounds, where a train was stopped to let the sheriff&#x27;s men and their prisoners get on board.  
As soon as this was known the mob began to gather, howling for vengeance against the man who had assisted in the escape of their prey. The cry, &quot;Come on to Loper&#x27;s,&quot; was raised, and a few minutes later bricks were crash- ing through the windows. Loper met the mob with a rifle. They paid no heed to him, and he was forced into the back part of the building, where he was compelled to witness the complete de- struction of his property.  
  
The restaurant was the largest in the city, and had a large trade. Within an hour it was a complete wreck. All of the furniture was taken out and piled on top of the automobile, which had been turned over on the street, and then a match was applied to the gaso- line tank. The bonfire raged until mid- night. The police were utterly power- less to cope with the mob and the fire department, which had been called out, was not allowed to extinguish the flames.  
During the attack an attempt was made to do bodily harm to Mayor Reece.  
At 10 o&#x27;clock Louis Johnson, a 19- year-old boy, was found dead in a rear stairway leading to the basement of a downtown building. He had been shot through the groin.  
At the time the riot began Eugene W. Chafin, the Prohibition candidate for President, was addressing a meet- ing in the courthouse yard. A negro pursued by a mob came dashing up the platform, and in endeavoring to protect the man from his pursuers the orator was struck in the face with a brick and badly injured.

The number of injured totals close  
to seventy-five. Troops have the situ­  
ation well in hand, and although trou­  
ble may break out at any time, it  
looks like peace.  
  
Public prejudice had been aroused  
against the negroes about a month  
ago, when Clergy A. Ballard was mur­  
dered in his own home by a negro,  
who is under indictment for murder,  
the indictment being found by a spec­  
ial grand jury convened by Judge  
Creighton of the circuit court.  
  
Lynching of Negro Planned.  
Early yesterday morning George  
Richardson was arrested for the as­  
sault on Mrs. Hallam, and immediate­  
ly there began to be mutterings of  
trouble.  
  
Threats were made that both ne­  
groes would be taken out and lynched.  
Officials Prepare a Ruse.  
  
Sheriff Charles Werner made ar­  
rangements to take the men to Bloom­  
ington and last evening the attention  
of the crowd around the jail was dis­  
tracted by an alarm of fire, while the  
men were placed in Harry T. Loper&#x27;s  
automobile and whisked away to the  
railroad station near the fair grounds,  
where a train was stopped to let the  
sheriff&#x27;s men and their prisoners get  
on board.  
  
As soon as this was known the mob  
began to gather, howling for vengence  
against the man who had assisted in  
the escape of their prey. The cry,  
&quot;Come on to Loper&#x27;s,&quot; was raised and  
a few minutes later bricks were  
crashing through the windows.  
  
Loper met the mob with a rifle.  
They paid no heed to him, and he was  
forced into the back part of the build­  
ing, where he -was compelled to wit­  
ness the complete destruction of his  
property.  
  
Restaurant is Wrecked.  
  
The restaurant was the largest in  
the city and had a large trade. Within  
an hour it was a complete wreck. All  
of the furniture was taken out and  
piled on top of the automobile, which  
had been turned over on the street,  
and then a match was applied to the  
gasoline tank. The bonfire raged un­  
til midnight.  
  
The police were utterly powerless to  
cope with the mob and the fire depart­  
ment, which had been called out. was  
not allowed to extinguish the flames.

100 wounded, tbe streets were full of

helpless to control the situation.

All this turmoil grows out of an at­

spirited out of town, and the mob,  
balked in its vengeance. Immediately

Springfield, 111., all through Friday  
night. Two men were killed, nearly  
100 wounded, the streets were full of  
militia, and rioters set lire to negro  
houses in all parts of the black belt.  
  
The fire department was intimidated  
and overawed by the rioters, and until  
the arrival of 1,000 additional State  
soldiers the authorities wore practically  
helpless to control the situation.  
  
Mob Balked by Rnu,  
  
All this turmoil grows out of an at­  
tempt to lynch a negro who had at­  
tacked a write woman. Tlie negro was  
spirited out of town, and the mob,  
balked In its vengeance, immediately  
turned on the man who loaned his auto­  
mobile to the authorities to enable tliem  
to convey the negro to a place of safe­  
ty. This was the spark that started  
the riot.  
  
Spccial trains were hurried from De­  
catur, Jacksonville, Hiooinington, Pe­  
oria, and half a dozen other towns,  
bearing infantry, cavalry and artillery.  
  
Early in the state of riot all the sa­  
loons and disorderly houses in the city  
were closed by the Mayor, itnd the mili­  
tiamen did their best to prevent the col­  
lecting of any crowds in the streets.  
Their efforts were fut ile, however. They  
would disperse a crowd In one neigh­  
borhood, and It immediately reassem­  
bled in another.  
  
When at 2 a. 111. the burning of negro  
houses commenced the negroes retali­  
ated by shooting from the upper stories  
of the houses in the neighborhood where  
the torch was applied. A number of  
persons trere hit during those fusillades  
and were carried away by their friends  
before their identity was discovered.  
  
OrlKln of tho Trouble*  
  
The inciting cause of the trouble was  
8.11 assault made on Friday 011 Mrs.  
Karl Ilullam, wife of a street car con­  
ductor. Mrs. llallani, whose husband  
works at night, was pulled from her  
lied fit midnight by a negro, who then  
dragged her into a garden in the rear  
of the house, where I10 assaulted her.  
  
This ts tlie last straw 011 the mind3  
of the whites of the city, the hatred  
against the blacks having been smolder­  
ing since a month ago, when Clergy A.  
Ballard was sUiln in his home by a  
negro, who, it is said, had entered the  
Ballard home in an attempt to assault  
Mr. Ballard&#x27;s young daughter.  
  
George Richardson, a negro, was ar­  
rested for tlie asasult upon Mrs. Hal­  
lam and placed in the city jail with  
Joseph James, who was accused of the  
Ballard murder.  
  
Mutterings of mob violence began  
soon aftor the Richardson identification  
by the woman, and a great crowd col­  
lected about the jail. After Richard­  
son had been identified by Mrs. llallam  
the crowds grew even more violent, and  
it was decided to take the prisoner out  
of town.  
  
Sheriff Charles Wtifher made ar­  
rangements to take the men to Bloom­  
ington and the attention of the crowd  
around the jail was distracted by an  
alarm of fire while the men were placed  
in Harry T. ijoper&#x27;s automobile and  
whisked away to the railroad station  
near the fair grounds, where a train  
was stopped to let the sheriff&#x27;s men and  
their prisoners get 011 board.  
  
As soon as this was known the mob  
began to gather, howling for vengeance  
against tlie man who had assisted in  
the escape of their prey. The cry,  
&quot;Come on to Lopor&#x27;s,&quot; was raised, and  
ft few minutes later bricks were crash­  
ing through the windows. Loper met  
thiu* mob with a riHo. They paid 110  
heed to liim, and lie was forced into the  
back part of the building, where he was  
compelled to witness the complete de­  
struction of liis property.  
  
The restaurant was the largest in the  
city, and had a large trade. Within  
an hour it was a complete wreck. All  
of the furniture was taken out and  
piled 011 top of the automobile, which  
had been turned over on the street, and  
then a match was applied to the gaso­  
line tank. The bonfire raged until mid­  
night. The police were utterly power­  
less to cope with the mob and the flue  
department, which had been called out,  
was not allowed to extinguish the  
tl ames.  
  
During the attack an attempt wai  
made to do bodily harm to Mayor  
iteece.  
  
At 10 o&#x27;clock I/uiis Johnson, a 19­  
year-old boy, was found dead in a rear  
stairway leading to the basement of a  
downtown building, lie had been phot  
through the groin.  
  
At tiie time the riot began Eugene  
W. Clialin, the i&#x27;rohibition candidate  
for President, was addressing a meet­  
ing in the courthouse yard. A negro  
pursued by a mob came dashing up the  
platform, and in endeavoring to protect  
the man from his pursuers the orator  
was struck in the face with a brick and  
badly injured.

Two Persons Kilted, Many Injured,  
and Storea Wrecked After  
Lynching Is Foiled.  
  
NEGRO QUARTER IS BURNED.  
After Destroying Wjite Restaurant  
Houses of Blacks Are Fired  
by tbe Crowd.  
Riot, arson and slaughter held pos  
session of the blnck belt and levee of  
Springfield, 111., all through Friday  
night. Two men were killed, nearly  
100 wounded, the streets were full of  
mlllt la, and rioters set fire to negro  
houses In all parts of the black be!.  
The fire department was Intimidated  
and overawed by the rioters, and until  
tho arrival of 1,000 additional Statt  
soldiers t lie &#x27;authorities were practically  
helpless to control the situation.  
Mob nalkcd or Ilnee.  
All this turmoil grows out of nn at  
tempt to lynch a negro who had at­  
tacked a write womnn. The negro was  
spirited out of town, and the mob,  
bulked In Its venennce, Immediately  
turned on the man who loaned his auto­  
mobile to tho Authorities to enable them  
to convey tlw negro to a place of safe  
ty. This was tbe spark that&quot; started  
the riot.  
Special trains were hurried from De  
catur, Jacksonville. Bloomlngton, Pe­  
oria, and half a dozen other towns,  
bearing infantry, cavalry and artillery.  
Early in the state of riot all the sa  
loons and disorderly houses in the city  
were closed by the Mayor, and the mili  
tiamen did their best to prevent the col  
lecting of any crowds in the streets.  
Their efforts were futile, however. They  
would disperse a crowd In one neigh­  
borhood, and It Immediately reassem­  
bled In another.  
When-nt 2 a. in. the burning of negro  
houses commenced the negroes retali  
ated by shooting from the upper stories  
if the houses In the neighborhood where  
the torch was applied. A number of  
per ions were hit during these fusillades  
nn were carried away by tbelr friends  
before their Identity was discovered.  
Orlsln of the Trouble.  
The Inciting cause of the trouble was  
nn assault made on Friday on Mrs.  
Karl Ilallam, wife of a street car con  
ductor. Mrs. Ilallam, whose husband  
works at night wis pulled from her  
lied at midnight by a negro, who then  
drugged her Into a garden In the real  
of the house, where he assaulted her.  
This was the last straw on the minds  
of the whites of the city, the hatred  
against the blacks having been smolder  
ing since a month ago, when Clergy A.  
Ballard was slain In his home by a  
negro, who, it Is said, had entered the  
Ballard home In an attempt to assault  
Mr. Ballard&#x27;s young daughter.  
George Richardson, a negro, was ar  
rested for tbe asasult upon Mrs. Hal­  
lam and placed In the city Jail with  
Joseph James, who was accused of the  
Ballard murder.  
Mutterlngs of mob violence began  
soon after tbe Richardson Identification  
by the woman, and a great crowd col  
lected about the Jail. After Richard  
son had been Identified by Mrs. Hallam  
the crowds grew even more violent and  
It was decided to take the prisoner out  
of town.  
Sheriff Charles Werner made ar­  
rangements to take the men to Bloom­  
lngton and the attention of the crowd  
around the jail was distracted by an  
alarm of fire while the men were placed  
In Harry T.&#x27; Loper&#x27;s automobile and  
whisked away to the railroad station  
near the fair grounds, where a train  
was stopped to let the sheriff&#x27;s men and  
their prisoners get ou board.  
As soon nB this was known the mob  
began to gather, howling for vengeance  
against the man who had assisted in  
tho cseaiie of their prey. The cry,  
&quot;Come on to Loper&#x27;s,&quot; was raised, and  
a few minutes later bricks were crash­  
ing through the windows. Loper met  
the mob with a rifle. They paid no  
liccd to bliu, and he was forced Into the  
back part of the building, where he was  
compelled to witness the complete de­  
struction of his proiierty.  
Tho restaurant was the largest In the  
city, and had a large trade. Within  
an hour It was a complete wreck. All  
of the furniture was taken out and  
piled on toi of the automobile, which  
had been turned over on the street, and  
then a match was applied to the gaso­  
line tank. The bonfire raged until mid­  
night. The polb-e were utterly power­  
oks to eope with tlu1 mob and the firs  
lcpurtmcut, which h.ul been called out  
was not allowed to extinguish the  
tlames.  
During the attack an attempt was  
made to do bodily harm to Mayor  
Reeco.  
At 10 o&#x27;clock Louis Johnson, a19-year-old  
boy, was found dea.d In a rear  
stairway leading to the basement of a  
downtown building. He had been shot  
through the groin.  
At the time the riot began Eugena  
W. Chatlu, tbe Prohibition candidate  
for President, was addressing a meek  
tug In the courthouse yard- A negro  
pursued by a mob came dashing up ths  
platform, and In endeavoring toprpteet

Riot, arson and slaughter held pos­  
session of the black belt and levee of  
Springfield, 111., all through Friday  
night. Two men were killed, nearly  
100 wounded, the streets were full of  
militia, and rioters set fire to negro  
houses in all parts of the black belt.   
The fire department was intimidated  
and overawed by the rioters, and until  
the arrival of 1,000 additional State  
soldiers the authorities were practically  
helpless to control the situation.   
  
Mob Halked by Ruae.   
  
All this turmoil grows out of an at­  
tempt to lynch a negro who had at­  
tacked a white woman. The negro was  
spirited out of town, apd the mob,  
balked In its vengeance, Immediately  
turned on the man who loaned bls auto­  
mobile to the authorities to enable them  
to convey the negro to a place of safe­  
ty. This was the spark that started  
the riot.   
  
Special trains were hurried from De­  
catur, Jacksonville, Bloomington, Pe­  
oria, and half a dozen other towns,   
  
bearing infantry, cavalry and artillery.   
Early in the state of riot all the sa­  
loons and disorderly houses In the city  
were closed by the Mayor, and the mili­  
tiamen did their best to prevent the col­  
lecting of any crowds in the streets.  
Their efforts wore futile, however. They  
would disperse a crowd in one neigh­  
borhood, and it immediately reassem­  
bled in another.   
  
When at 2 a. in. the burning of negro  
houses commenced the negroes retali­  
ated by shooting from the upper stories  
of the houses in the neighborhood where  
the torch was applied. A number of  
persons were hit during these fusillades  
and were carried away by their friends  
before their Identity was discovered.   
  
Origin of the Trouble.   
  
The inciting cause of the trouble was  
an assault ina&lt;k&gt; on Friday on Mrs.  
Earl Hallam, wife of a street car con­  
ductor. Mrs. Hallam, whose husband  
works at night, was pulled from her  
bed at midnight by a negro, who then  
dragged her into a garden In the rear  
of the house, where he assaulted her.   
&#x27;ihls was the last straw on the minds  
of the whites of the city, the hatred  
against the blacks haring been smolder­  
ing since a month ago, when Clergy A.  
Ballard was slain In his home by a  
negro, who, it Is said, had entered the  
Ballard home in an attempt to assault  
Mr. Ballard’s young daughter   
George Richardson, a negro, was ar­  
rested for the assault upon Mrs. Hal­  
lam and placed in the city jail with  
Joseph James, who was accused of the  
Ballard murder.
