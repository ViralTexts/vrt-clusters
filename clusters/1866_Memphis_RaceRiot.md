THE FIRST RIOT.  
  
THE CITIZENS IN ARMS.  
  
MAYOR PARK REPORTED DRUNK.  
  
REGULAR TROOPS CALLED OUT.  
  
DEAD BODIES LIYING AROUND THE STREETS.  
  
[Special Dispatch to the Louisville Courier.]  
Memphis, May 1, P.M.  
The city is now in a great state of excitement over a riot which originated between some negroes and policemen about five o&#x27;clock this afternoon. The policemen, firemen, and regular troops have been called out in force.   
Two policemen named James Finn and Slatery have been seriously wounded, and Henry Dunn, Engineer of [[Na&#x27;s]] Fire Company, is mortally wounded. Several other policemen are reported wounded, some mortally, and all seriously.  
It is said that thirteen negroes have been killed. Seven have been seen lying dead. The riot originated from a fuss between a negro and a white boy. Under the present high state of excitement it is impossible to obtain reliable reports.  
The Board of Aldermen met this evening, but adjourned without doing any business. The Mayor afterwards called a special meeting and issued the following:  
Gentlemen of the Board of Aldermen:  
I find, as well as you and all good citizens, that the disturbance between the blacks and whites this evening requires prompt action on our part. In the absence of proper military aid, therefore, please authorize me, as Mayor, to secure such aid as may be required to quell and suppress all disturbance, and I will do it.  
[Signed]. [[John]] Park, Mayor.  
After remarks from several members of the Board, it adjourned without any action on this message.  
A late report says the regulars are not out but they will be out shortly. The Mayor is drunk and unfit for the emergency.  
LATER  
Memphis, May 1.  
The Sixteenth Regular Infantry has since been called out.  
Another negro has been shot.  
It is said that two white men were in with the negroes, and that white women on Causey street put their heads out of the windows, and bellowed &quot;hurrah for the negroes!&quot; This is an actual fact, but it is impossible to account for it.   
The streets are full of people, but entirely clear of negroes, as upon their first appearance they are shot down. A negro was almost beat to death a few moments ago on Adams street; another was shot dead near Court Square, and a third one killed near the [[Gayoro]] House.  
Capt. J. A. Hood, acting local editor of the Memphis Argus, narrowly escaped being shot through both legs by a Minnie ball, which passed throughout his coat and pants. The mob of negroes, Capt. Hood says, consisted of over one hundred and fifty, all armed with Minnie rifles, pistoles and knives.   
There has been considerable indiscrimate shooting by citizens, who are enraged, and perfectly wild with excitment.   
This has been a clear lesson to the negroes which will teach them to behave themselves.  
I do not anticipate that there will be any further disturbance--but few will promenade the streets for days to come.  
None of the negroes have yet been arrested. Two are lying dead in the station house.

MEMPhIs, May I.-The city is now in a  
great state of excitement over a riot which  
originated between some negroes and  
poliemen, about bo&#x27;clock this afternoon.  
The policemen, firemen and regular troops  
have been called out in force. Two police­  
men, named James Finn and Slatting, have  
been seriously wounded, and Henry Dunn,  
Engineer of No. 3 Fire Company, is mort­  
ally wounded. Several other policemen are  
reported wounded, some mortally, and all  
seriously. It is said that thirteen negroes  
have been killed. Seven have been seen  
lying dead. The riot originated from a  
fuss between a negro and a white boy? Un­  
der the present high state of excitement it  
is impossible to obtain a reliable report.  
The Board of Aldermen met, this evening,  
but adjourned without doing any business.  
The Mayor afterward called a special meet  
ing and issued the following:  
&quot;Gentlemen of the Board of Aldermen  
I find, as well as you and all good citizens,  
that from the disturbance between the  
lacks and whites this evening it requires  
prompt action on our part. In the absence  
of proper military aid, therefore, please  
authorize me, as Mayor, to procure such aid  
as may be required to quell and suppress  
all disturbance, and I will do it.  
  
&quot;JOHN PArK, Mayor.&quot;  
  
After remarks from several members the  
Board adjourned without any action on  
the message. The streets are full of peo-  
ble, and entirely clear of negroes, as  
upon their first appearance they are shot  
down. A negro was almost beat to death a  
few moments ago on Adams street. Another  
was shot dead near Court square, and a  
third one killed near the Gayoso House.  
Captain I. A. Hood, acting local editor of  
the MMemphis Argus, narrowly escaped being  
shot through both legs by a minnie ball  
which passed through his coat and pants.  
The mob of negroes, Captain Hood says,  
consisted of over 150 negroes, all armed  
with minnie rifles.

MEMPHIs, May L.-The 16th Regular In­  
fantry has since been called out. Anether  
negro has been shot. It is said that two  
white men were in with the negroes, and  
that white women, on Causey street, put  
their heads out of the windows and hur  
rahed for the negroes. This is the fact, but  
it is impossible to account for it. There

Further disturbance is not anticipated,

in a fair way of general renewal. Negroes  
are being pursued and shot down in the  
streets. Some negro shanties in the sub­

seeking refuge at the fort. Another white  
man is reported killed by a negro. In al

Special Dispatch to the Louisville Courier.  
MEJtrnif, Mi . 1. p. m. The city is  
now in a&quot; great state of excitement over a  
riot which originated between some negroes  
and policemen about 5 o&#x27;clock this after­  
noon. The policemen, firemen and regular  
troops hac been called out in force. Two  
jiolicemcn named James Finn and Slattery,  
have been seriously wounded, and Henry  
Dunn, engineer of No. 3 fire company, is  
mortally wounded. Several other police­  
men are reported wounded, some mortally,  
and all seriously.  
It is said that thirteen negroes have been  
killed. Seven have been seen lying dead.  
The riot originated from a fuss between a  
negro and a white boy. Under the present  
high state of excitement it is impossible to  
obtain a reliable report.  
The Board of Aldermen met this evening,  
but adjourned without doing anything. The  
Mayor afterwards called a special meeting  
and issued the following :  
Gentlemen of tlic Board of Aldermen : I find,  
as well as you and all good citizens, that the  
disturbance between the blacks and whites  
this evening requires prompt action on our  
part. In the absence of proper military aid,  
therefore, please authorize me, as Mayor,  
to secure such aid as may be required to  
quell and suppress all disturbance, and I  
will do it.  
Signed Jojin Park, Mayor.  
After remarks from several members of  
the Board, it adjourned without any action  
on the message.  
The streets are full of people, but entirely  
clear of negroes, as upon their first appear­  
ance they are shot down. A negro was al­  
most beat to death a few moments ago, on  
Adams street, another was shot dead near  
Court Square, and a third one killed near  
  
the (jayoso House.  
Capt. J. A. Hood, acting local editor of
