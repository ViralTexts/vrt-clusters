Statements of Steamboatmen   
The steamboats John T. Moore and La Bella bring some intelligence of the riot at Colfax, in Great parish. The former boat passed that place Monday, and the officers state that they saw a large body of colored men, armed with shotguns and other weapons, on the bank and they did not land. At Montgomery, twenty-five miles above, they had taken on board Judge W. R. Rutland, who stated he had been forced to flee from his home. He states that Representative Ward had taken armed possession of the courthouse at Colfax. Judge Rutland, fearing he would be assasinated if he remained there, went to Montgomery and remained there until taken on board by the John T. Moore. While away from home he learned that his house had been sacked. As the boat passed Colfax it was hailed by Mr. Calhoun, but did not take him on board, being unable to make the landing on account of the violent wind. On arriving at Alexandria they learned the LaBelle, which had passed them, had taken Mr. Calhoun on board, but that he had been taken off again under arrest by the sheriff at Pineville. At Alexandria were a body of about 200 armed men who were going to Colfax to attack the rioteers. These men took a six pound cannon from the boat, and proposed to take it with them. They also took from the Durfee eleven casks of bacon and twenty barrels of flour. It was reported at Alexandria that the rioters were shooting all who refused to join them. [a]  
The La Bella, coming after the John T. Moore, made a landing a little below Colfax, and took Mr. Calhoun on board at Curry Point, very near his own plantation. Mr. Calhoun said he had been in the woods since Tuesday of last week, that his house had been seized by rioters and he was obliged to get away. At Colfax the boat was hailed by a woman. Mr. Calhoun states that she was a teacher, from New Orleans, in a private family. On reaching Pineville the Belle was boarded by armed men from Alexandria, who took Mr. Calhoun off with them. They told him no harm would come to him if he was innocent, as he said he was, of creating the riot. He was searched, and a letter found on him from Representative Ward to Governor Kellogg, reciting the existing disturbance and asking for assistance. The Belle was obliged to come down and leave Mr. Calhoun in their hands, and it is feared he will suffer violence. The cause of the riot seems to be the duplicate commission of the parish officers. Governor Kellogg had, at the instigation of Rutland, and others, commissioned Nash sheriff, and others who ran on the Fusion ticket. Some of those on this ticker were of the party who are charged with having burned the house of Judge Phillips and murdered Recorder White September 25, 1871. Mr. Ward represented these facts to Governor Kellogg, who thereafter issued other commissions of the elected republicans. Mr. Ward took the commissions, went to Grant and demanded the offices. He was refused possession of the courthouse and then took it. Richardson and Rutland, who, it is alleged, had been in communication with the puny woods Democrats, sent to them for assistance to remake the offices. Mar. Ward then ordered Rutland and RIcharsonto leave town. Dr. Cockrell and Mr. Paul, the Fusion candidate for sheriff, are leading the men from Alexandria, who are going to Grant to fight. It is believed that they will be reinforces from the parishes of Catahoula,   
Natchitoches, Sabine, Winn, and Rapides. Hadnott, the member of the Odd Fellows’ Hall Legislature, is said to be among the active members of the bands from piney woods.   
  
Statement of Judge Rutland  
Judge W. R. Rutland, who arrived here yesterday morning on the steamboat John T. Moore furnishes the Picayune with the following version. In reference to the statement that he wrote a letter to the New Orleans REPUBLICAN, which we refused to publish, we can only say we never received any communication from him:  
The Lynch returning board ignored the election of out parish officers, and Mr. Kellogg appointed a set of men to fill the vacancies, but who did not qualify according to law, and allowed the time to elapse in which they are required by law to do it in. Mr. Kellogg, at my instance, commissioned all officers who were elected, including both Republicans and Fusionists, white and colored, except a parish judge who had already qualified and was a Republican.   
Wars, a member of the Dryades street Legislature, learning that Mr. Kellogg was going to issue these commissions, hastened to Colfax and took violent and forcible possession of the courthouse and offices with a mob. There was a proposition to hold a mass meeting of the people for the purpose of expressing their condemnation in a quiet wat at the course pursued by these men, but when the day arrived for the meeting to thave been called together there were such violent demonstrations made by Ward, Register and Flowers, and the armed band that was backing them, that the few white people who had the matter in hand did not pretend to do anything, but quietly returned to their homes without going near the courthouse, or assembling anywhere. After this I was advised by my friends to seek safety, as my life was in danger. I took their advice and started to cross the river to Mr. J.C. Morantini’s place, but when I got to the river I was interviewed by another friend, who told me that it would not be safe for me to return to this side of the river that night. After crossing the river I was met again by persons who told me there was a determination to assassinate me if I returned to the Colfax side of the river.  
At twelve o’clock at night I found out that the mob had sacked my house and that they were going to attempt to cross the river and arrest me. I made my escape by Mr. Morantini furnishing me with a horse and guide, and I went to Montgomery, where I found my family, which had preceded me by boat. Since that time I have been quit and have done nothing, remaining at Montgomery. I did not go out of town at all until I got on board the steamboat John T. Moore to come to his place. In passing colfax, last monday morning, I was discovered on board of the boat by the mob of negroes, and my ears were greeted with prolonged and horrific yells from the shore, and many, mounting  theri horses, got their guns and pursued after the boar from some distance, some even following a distance over seven miles.   
I will state also that on the way down, the boat was hailed to take a Mr. Calhoun on , but she could not make the landing owing to a very violent wind that was blowing at the time. The steamboat La Belle came along directly after, and made the landing, and took Calhoun on, and passed us before we got to Alexandria. When we got to Alexandra I learned that Calhoun had been arrested and had been taken off of the boat. The gentlemen who took him from the board stated that they were going to take him to Colfax and make him quit to mischief and restore the peace that he was the promoter and head cause of, as he was principally responsible for what had been. But I do not believe (although, of course, I did not see the persons who had him in custody) that any violence against him was meditaded; but it is hard to say what an angry set of men will do under such circumstances. I have good evidence to believe that the destruction to my property resulted from the failure to assassinate me, which has been premeditated.           
The white people in Grant parish and in adjoining parishes were assembling to resist the encroachments of these men. Ward and his desperadoes have been and doubtless are now prowling about the country, taking houses, guns and whatever else they could lay their hands upon. Ward and his men about a week ago, killed two peaceable colored men, and a perfect reign of terror is now instituted in Colfax. This is the first statement for any newspaper that I have made, except for a letter I wrote to the New Orleans REPUBLICAN, which they refused to publish.   
I will state that all my personal property has been taken away and destroyed; that the coffin spoken of contained the body of a littler girl, who died in Lake Charles in 1867, which I had taken up and was going to reinter in Red River, and that I legend in Alexadnria, as I came through on Monday, that a negro mob had taken it out and burned. A great many colored men were in Alexandria, who had run away from Colfax to keep out of the trouble

resentative Ward has taken armed posses  
sionof the courthouse at Colfax. Judge Rut­  
land, fearing he would be assassinated if he  
remained there, went to Montgomery and  
remained there until taken on board by the  
John T. Moore. While away from homo he  
learned his house had been sacked. As the  
boat passed Colfax it was hailed by Mr.  
Calhoun, but did not take him on board,  
being unable to make the landing on ac­  
count of the violent wind. On arriving at  
Alexandria they learned the La3elie, which  
bad passed them, had taken Mr. Calhoun  
on board, but that he had been taken off  
again under arrest by the sheriff at Pine­  
ville. At Alexandria were a body of about  
&#x27;J00 armed men who were going to Coltax to  
attack the rioters. These men took a six­  
pound cannon from the boat, and proposed  
to take it with them. They also took from  
the Durfee eleven casks of baoon and twen  
ty barrels of flour. It wa» reported at  
Alexandria that the rioters were shooting  
all who refused to join them  
The La Belle, coming after the John T.  
Moore, made a landing m little below Col­  
fax, and took Mr. Calhoun on hoard at  
Curry Point, very near his own plantation.  
Mr. Calhoun said he had been in t he woods  
sinco Tuesday of last week, that his  
house had been seized by the rioters,  
and he obliged to get away. At Col­  
fax the boat was hailed by a womau.  
Mr. Calhoun stated that she was  
a teacher, from New Orleans, in a priva f e  
family. On reaching Pinevillo the Belle  
was boarded by armed men from Alexan  
dria, who took Mr. Calhoun off with them  
They told him no harm would come to him  
if he was innorent, as he said he Was, of  
creating the riot. He was searched, and a  
letter found on him from Representative  
Ward to Governor Kellogg, reciting the  
existing di-turbance and asking for as  
sistauce. The Belle was obliged to come  
down and leave Mr. Calhoun in their hands,  
and it is feared he will suffer violence.  
The cause of the riot seems to be the dupli  
cate commissioning of the parish officers.  
Governor Kellogg had, at the instigation of  
Rutland and others, commissioned Nash  
sheriff, and others who ran on the Fusion  
ticket. Some of those on this ticket were  
of the party who are charged with having  
burned the house of Judge Phillip# and  
murdered Recorder White September lift,

Governor Kellogg, who thereupon issued  
other commissions to the elected Repub­  
licans. Mr. Ward took the commissions,  
went to Grant and demanded the offiees.  
He wa» refused possession of the court­  
honss and then took it. Richardson  
and Rutland, who, it i» alleged, bad  
been in communication with the  
piney woods Democrats, sent to them  
for assistance to retake the offices.  
Mr. Ward then ordered Rutland and Rich­  
ardson to leave town. Dr. Cockrell and  
Mr. Paul, the Fusion candidate for sheriff,  
are leading the men from Alexandria, who  
are going to Grant to fight. It. is believed  
that they will be reinforced from tbo par­  
ishe# of Catahonla, Natchitoches, Sabine,  
Winn and Rapides. Hadnott, the member  
of the Odd Fellows&#x27; Hall Legislature, is  
said to be among the active members of tho  
bands from the piney woods.  
STATEMENT OF JUDGE RUTLAND.  
Judge W. U. Rutland, who arrived here  
yesterday morning on the steamboat John  
T. Moore, furnishes the Pienyunt with the  
following version. In reference to the  
statement that he wrote a letter to the New  
Orleans Republican, which we refused to  
publish, w e can only say we never received  
  
any communication from him:  
The Lynch returning board ignored tho  
election of our parish officers, and Mr. Kel­  
logg appointed a set of men to till the va­  
cancies, but who did not qualify according  
to law, aud allowed the litne to elapRO in  
which they are required by law to do it  
in. Mr. Kellogg, at my instance, commis­  
sioned all officers who were elected, includ­  
ing both Republicans and Fusioniats, white  
and colored, except a parish judge who had  
already qualified and was a Republican.  
Ward, a member of the Drvades street  
Legislature, learning that Mr. Kellogg was  
goiug to issue these commissions, hastened  
to Colfax and took violent and forcible pos­  
session of the courthouse and offices with »  
mob. There was a proposition to hold a  
mass meeting of the people for the purpose  
of expressing their condemnation in a  
quiet way at the course pursued by these  
men, but when the day arrived for the  
meeting to have been called together  
there were such violent demonstrations  
made by Ward, Register and Flowers, anil  
the armed band tnat was backing them,  
that the lew white people who had  
the matter in hand did not pretend  
to do anything, but quietly returned to thear  
homes without going near the courthouse,  
or assembling anywhere. After this I was  
advised by friends to seek safety, as my  
lite was in danger, t took their advice and  
started to cross the river to Mr. J. C.  
Morantim&#x27;# place, but when I got to the  
river 1 was interviewed by another friend,  
who told ine that it would not be safe for  
me to return to tliiw «ioeof the river that  
night. Alter crossing the river I ara# met  
again by person# who told ote there was a  
determination to assassinate Ine if 1 re­  
turned to the Colfax side of the river.  
At twelve o&#x27;clock wt night { found out  
that the mob had sacked my house aud that  
they were going to attempt to cross the  
rive- anti arrest me. I made my escape by  
Mr. Morantim furnishing me witli a nurse  
and guide, and 1  
where I found iny family, which had pre­  
ceded tue by boat. Since that time 1 have  
been quiet and have done nothing, remain­  
ing at Montgomery, i did not go out ot  
town nt all until I got on board of the  
steamboat John T. Moore to come to this  
place. In passing Colfax, last Mond ty  
morning, l was discotcred on board of the  
boat by the tnob of negroes, and my can*  
re greeted with prolonged and terriffu  
yells from the shore, and many, mounting  
tbeir hors a, got their gout* ana pursued  
after the boat or some distance, some even  
folio * &lt; ,g a fliatafice ot over seven miles.  
I will sta&#x27;O also that on the way dowu,  
the bout was bailed to take t# Mr. Calhoun  
on, but she could hot make tha landing,  
owing to a very violent wind that was blow­  
ing at the time. The Steamboat La Belle  
•came along direatly after, aad made the  
Un4i»g, aad luvk t&#x27;alfaou* oa, and f &gt;M«d  
went to Montgomery,  
  
got to Alexandria I learned that Calhoun  
had been arrested and had been taken off  
of the boat. The gentlemen who took him  
from the boat stated that they were going  
to take hint to Colfax aud make him quiet  
the mischief and restore the peace that he  
was the promoter and head cause ot. as he  
was principally responsible for what had  
been. But I do not believe (although, of  
course, I did not see the persons who bad  
him in custody) that any violence against  
him was meditated: but it is hard to say  
what an angry set of men will do under  
such circumstances. I have good evidence  
to believe that the destruction to my prop­  
erty resulted from the failure to assassinate  
me, which had been premeditated.  
The white people in Grant parish and in  
adjoining parishes were assembling to re­  
sist the encroachments of these men. Ward  
and his desperadoes have been and doubt­  
less are now prowling about the country,  
taking horses, guns and whatever else they  
could lay their hands upon. Ward and his  
men, about a week ago, killed two peace­  
able colored men, and a perfect reign of  
terror is now instituted in Colfax. This is  
the first stiiteme-ut for auv newspaper that  
I have made, except a letter I wrote the  
New Orleans Republican, which they re­  
fused to publish.  
I will state that all my personal property  
has been taken away and destroyed; that  
the coffin spoken of contained the body of  
a little girl, who died iu Lake Chatles iu  
1867, which I had taken up and was going  
to reinter in Red River, and that I learned  
in Alexandria, as I came through on Mon­

of the river that night. After crossing the river  
I was met again by persons who told me that  
there was a determination to ase assinate me if I  
retarned to the Colfax side of the river. At U2

nd that they were going to attempt to cros the  
liver and arrest me. I made my cscape by Mr.  
Morantinl furnishing me with a horse and  
guile, and went t Montgomery, where I  
found iy family, which had preceded me by

have done nothing, remaining at Moltgomery.  
I did not go out of town at all until I got on  
board of the steainboat John T. Moore to comre  
to this place. In passing Colfax last Monday  
morning I was discovered on board of the boat  
by the mob of negroes, and my ears were greeted  
with prolonged and terrifle yells from the shore,  
and many mounting their horses got their guns  
and pursued after the boat for some distance,

could not make the landing, owing to a very

Meamboat LaBelle came along directly after,  
and made the landing and took Calhoun on  
board, and passed us before we got to Alexan­  
dria. When we got to Alexandria I learned that  
alhoun had been arrested and had been taken  
I the boat. The gentlemen who took him from  
the boat stated that they were going to take him  
to Colfax and make him quiet the mischief and  
restore the peace, that he was the promoter and  
head cause thereof, as he was principally respon­  
tte tof hhat had been dong alit do hot tee  
although, of course, I did not see the  
ersons who had him in custody--that any vio­  
lence against him was meditated; but it is hard  
to say what an angry set will do under such cir­  
cumstances. I have good evidence to believe  
that the destruction of my property resulted  
from the failure to assassinate me, which had  
been premeditated.

The Lynch returmncr board, so-call  
ed, had no returns, and in this case did  
not assume to declare the election of  
the parish officers. Kelloersr. however.  
undertook to appoint men to what he  
called vacancies, but they did not qual  
ity according to law, and allowed the  
time stipulated by law to pass. Kellogg  
then commissioned officers who had  
really been elected, both Republican

tne I&#x27;arisn Judge, a Kepnblican who  
had already qualified. .

(F [rom the Alexandria Democrat, 16th.]  
Since our issue of last week we have taken  
some pains to poet ourselves in regard to the  
serious troubles at Colfax, in the parish of  
Grant, and have arrived at a clear statement  
of the whole cause of the trouble and its nat­  
Sural consequences, and we assure our readers  
they can rely on the pei feet truth of the facts  
we shall write.  
The-Lynch returning board ignored the elec­  
tion of the parish officers, and Mr Kellogg ap­  
pointed&#x27;a set-of men to fill the vacancies, but  
who die uotgqatlify according to law, and al­

missioned all officers wh6 were elected, includ­  
ing both Republicans and Fndlonists, white  
and colered, except a parish judge, who had  
already qualified and-was a Republican.  
Ward, a member of the Dryades street Leg­  
islature, learning that Mr. Kellogg was going  
to issue these comlmissions, hastened to Colfax  
and took violent and forcible possession of the  
court-house and offices with a mnob. There
