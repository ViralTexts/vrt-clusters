PIERCE CITY MOB RAIDED ARMORY FOR THEIR WEAPONS.  
  
Homes of NEgroes Burned and One Man Cremated--But Few Blacks Remain in the City, and These Must Leave--Bloodhounds Lead Officers to Room and Bed Said to Have Been Occupied by a Suspect Now Under Arrest.  
  
FUNERAL OF MURDERED GIRL IS WITNESSED BY THOUSANDS.  
  
REPUBLIC SPECIAL  
Pierce City, Mo., Aug. 20.--Quiet has succeeded excitement and the terrible scenes of the last three days, and it is believed there will be no further bloodshed. However, if negroes suspected of the murder of Miss Wilde and now under arrest in different cities were brought here to-night, there is not the slightest doubt that their lives would pay the forfeit if their connection with the crime could be established.   
For nearly fifteen hours, ending at noon to-day, this town of 3,000 people had been in the hands of a mob of armed whites, determined to drive every negro from its precincts.  
In addition to the lynching last night of Will Godley, accused of the wanton murder of Miss Gazelle Wilde, and the shooting to death of his grandfather, French Godley, the mob to-day cremated Pete Hampton, a negro, in his home, set the torch to the houses of five blacks, and with the aid of the State militia rifles, stolen from the local company&#x27;s arsenal, drove dozens of negroes from town. After noon the excitement died down, the mob gradually dispersing, more from lack of negroes upon which to wreak their hatred than from any other cause.  
Many Negroes in Hiding.  
Many of the negroes who fled the city are hiding in the surrounding woods, while others have gone greater distances in seeking safety. Every negro has left the town, except a few railway porters, known to be respectable, but who must also leave.  
The citizens of Pierce City say that, as negroes have committed several such crimes in the last ten years, none shall live there in the future, the same feeling already existing at Monnett, four miles east of Pierce City, and the end of a Frisco division. It may be necessary to change all porters in Springfield hereafter.  
It is now believed that the man Will Goodley was not the real culprit. A negro named Starks, under arrest at Tulsa, I. T., across the border from here, tallies exactly with the description of the murderer. He is held there awaiting identification. Unless the man is bought back here it is believed there will be no further trouble. If returned here, he will surely be lynched.

Never to Return to the City,&#x27;  
  
3y Associated Press.  
Pierco City, Mo., Aug. 20 For near­  
ly fifteen hours, ending about noon  
today, this town of .1000 people, has  
been In the hands of a mob of armed  
whiles, determined to drive every ne­  
gro fiom its precincts. In addition to  
the lynching last night of Will God­  
ley, accused of the wanton murder of  
Miss Gazello Wild, and the shooting  
to death of his grandfather, Fiench  
Godloy, ihe mob today cremated Pete  
Hampton, an aged negro, in ins home,  
and set the torch to the houses of five  
blacks and with the state militia  
rifles, stolen from the local company&#x27;s  
arsenal, drove dozens of negroes fiom  
town. After noon tho excitement  
died down and tho mob gradually dis­  
persed, more fiom lack of negroes  
on which to wreak their hatred than  
fiom any other cause.  
Many negroes whe fled from the  
city are hiding in the surioundlng  
woods, while others have gone dis­  
tances In seek&#x27;ng safety.  
Every&quot; negro has left town except a  
few railway porters known to be le­  
spectable&#x27;, but who must al.so leave.  
Tho citizens fay that ns the negroes  
have committed several such crimes  
In the last ten years, none shall live  
there in the future and the same feel­

end of the Frisco passenger division.  
It is now believed that Will Godley,

picionThe Ilorrlble Murder of  
Miss Wild.  
Pierce City. Mo-, August 20. For  
nearly fifteen hours ending about noon  
today this town of 3.000 people has been  
In the hands of a mob of armed whites,  
determined to drive every negro from  
its precincts. In addition to the lynch­  
ing last night of &quot;William Godley, ac­  
cused of the wanton murder of Miss  
Gazelle &quot;Wild, and the shooting to death  
of his grandfather. French Godley, the  
mob today cremated Peter Hampton,  
an aged negro, in his home, set the  
torch to the houses of five blacks and  
with the aid of the state militia rifle3  
stolen from the local company&#x27;s ar­  
senal, drove dozens of negroes from  
town.  
This afternoon the excitement died  
down, the mob gradually dispersing,  
more from lack of negroes upon whom  
to wreak their hatred than for anv  
other cause. Many of the negroes who  
fled the city are hiding in the sur  
rounding woods, while others have gone  
greater distances in seeking safety.  
Every negro has left the town except  
a few railway porters known to be re­  
spectable, but these must also leave,  
The citizens of Pierce City say that as  
negroes have committed several crimes  
in the last ten years none shall live  
there In the future, the same feeing  
already existing at Monetta, four miles  
east of Pierce City, and the end of the  
Frisco passenger division. It may be  
necessary for the road to change all  
porters In Springfield hereafter.  
It is now believed that the man, &quot;Wil

whites, determined to drive every  
negro from its precincts. In addition  
to the lynching of Will Godley, ac­  
cused of the wanton murder of Mlsa

ueath of his grandfather, French God­

an aged negro, in his&#x27; home, setting  
the torch to the houses of five blacks,  
and with the aid of the state militia  
rifles, stolen from the local company&#x27;s  
arsenal, drove dozens of negroes from  
town. After noon the excitement died  
down, the mob gradually dispersing,  
more from lack of negroes upon which  
to wreak their hatred than for any  
other cause. Many of the negroes who  
fled the city are hiding in the sur­
