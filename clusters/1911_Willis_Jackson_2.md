The mob was evidently greatly dis appointed on being outwitted, bu under the leadership of &quot;Citizen&#x27; Josh Ashly, who had arrived in a large automobile, they mobiliz again, boarded automobiles, and started in pursuit. The officers bad departed twenty minutes in advance There were a dozen or more automo biles occupied by the infuriated mob The distance from Anderson to Green ville is 37 miles and the 10.ds muddy on account of a hard rain las night. At Piedmont, 22 miles from Anderson, the mob had gained 8 minutes on the officers, being only 12 minutes behind. The officers pass ed Piedmont at 1:04 o&#x27;clock and ar rived at Greenville at 1:50 o&#x27;clock. The first car of the mob arrived in that city just five minutes later, but at that time the prisoner was on his way to Spartanburg. Sheriff King had telephoned to Sheriff Poole at Greenville and the latter had in read- iness a large automobile. A trans- fer from the old machine was made in a twinkling of an eye and the big car then started for Spartanburg, 40 miles distant Greenville, S. C., Oct. 10.-In the depths of a forest six miles north of Greenville an armed mob of twenty- five men, headed by &quot;Citizen&quot; Josh Ashley, of Honea Path, a member of Anderson county&#x27;s legislative dele- gation, overpowered Deputy Sheriff Martin of Anderson county and Sher- iff J. Perry Poole of Greenville coun ty this afternoon and took from their custody one Willis Jackson, a 17-year- old negro, charged with criminally assaulting the 11-year-old daughter of a prominent citizen of Honea Path at 7:30 o&#x27;clock this morning. The trembling negro was placed in the car in which Ashley and four other men rode, followed by a train of sev- eral automobiles from Anderson and Greenville counties, loaded with de- termined men and bristling with shot guns and rifles, the ring-leaders turned in their fury and started to- ward Honea Path. Promises were made the sheriff that the negro would be carried back to the scene of his crime and the &quot;Older heads&quot; con- sulted as to what should be done. with him. There is a general feel ing, however, that the negro will never see Honea Path alive. The capture of the alleged rapist conclud- ed one of the most sensationaf man- chases this section of the country has ever known, Greenville dispatch, 10th. A long distance telephone message from Honea Path says that at 11:24 o&#x27;clock tonight Willis Jackson was swung to a telephone pole by one of his heels and his body riddled with bullets. The negro was taken to the identical spot where the crime wa committed and from there to the, nearest telephone pole and swung up by one foot.[a]  
  
AT HANDS OF UNKNOWN MOB.   
Thus Did Willis Jackson Meet His Death Says the Coroner&#x27;s Jury. That Willis Jackson came to his death from gunshot wounds at the hands of an unknown mob was the verdict reached by the coroner&#x27;s jury at Honea Path today. The horribly mutilated body was viewed by the jury and was eut down from the tel- ephone pole by Coroner Beasly, The mother of the negro refused to take the body. She says she wouldn&#x27;t have anything to do with a son of hers that would commit such a crime. The negroes refused to allow the body to be interred in their burial grounds, so it was buried at the ex- pense of the county on the home place of Melvin Ashley. Several fing- ers of the negro were severed for souvenirs during the night and the rope, as it fell to the ground, was cut in pieces and distributed among a large crowd that had gathered to see him cut from the pole. Coroner Beasly and Sheriff King arrived on the scene at 9:30 o&#x27;clock this morning and, after experiencing a little trouble in getting a jury will- ing to serve, the iзquest was begun. The body was viewed and the jury then repaired to the office of Magis- trate Wilsoh to hear the testimony. Five or six witnessess were examin- ed, but it was impossible to locate any person who admitted seeing the lynching. Everybody in the commu- nity was reticent and the examina- tion of witnesses required only a short time. Sheriff King forwarded a short re- port from Honea Path to Govern r Blease. In the report he referred the Governor to the newspaper ac- counts, which the sheriff stated were correct in every particular as far as he could determine. &quot;Citizen&quot; Josh Ashly was not a witness of the lynching and neither was his son Joe Ashley. These men left the mob with the negro before the crowd reached Honea Path. At Honea Path Mayor Sullivan pleaded that the law be allowed to dispose of the negro. He read a telegram he had received from Govenor Blease, asking that the mob allow the law to take its course and stated that he would obtain a special term of court to try the negro within two weeks. Pleading was of no avail, however, for, afler taking the negro before the little girl for a second identificatior, the crowd proceeded to the scene of attack and there he was s&#x27;rung up by his l. f. foot. The negro&#x27;s body was lit rally riddled with bullets, not a spot as large as a silver dollar remaining where bullets did not pierce.

coroner&#x27;s jury at Honea Path today.  
The horribly mutifatea body was  
viewed by the jury, and then cu1

Coroner Beasley. Tne mother of the  
negro refused to take the body, say­  
ing she would not hO anything to  
do with a son of hers that would com­

lused to allow the body to be interred  
in their~ burial grounds, so it was  
~buried at ithe.expense of the county.  
SeNleral fingers of the negro had  
been severed for souVenirs during the  
night, and the rope as&#x27; :t fell to &#x27;the  
ground, was cut in pieces and distrib­

-gathered to see- the negro cut from  
the pole.

he would order a special term of courn

Anderson, Oct. 11.-&quot;Willis Jackson  
came to his death from gunshot  
-wounds at the hands of an unknown  
mob&quot; was the verdict retchel by the  
coroner&#x27;s jury at Honea Path today.  
The horribly mutitatedt body was  
viewed by the jury, and then cut  
down from the telephone pole by  
Coroner Beasley. Tne mother of the  
negro refused to take the body, say­  
ing she would not ha anything to  
,do with a son of hers that would com­  
mit such a crime. The negroes re­  
-fised to allow the body to be interred  
In their burial grounds, so it was  
~buried at tthe.expense of the county.  
Sexieral fingers of the negro had  
been severed for souv&#x27;enirs during the  
night, and the rope as&#x27; t fell to &#x27;the  
ground, was -cut in pieces and distrib­  
-uted among a large crowd that had  
gathered to sde the negro cut from  
the pole.  
Coroner Beasley and Sheriff King  
-arrived on the scene at 9.30 o&#x27;clock  
this morning, and after experiencing  
a little trouble in getting a jury will­  
ing .to serve the inquest was begun.  
&#x27;The body was viewed, and the jury  
then repaired to the office of Magis­  
tiate Wilson to hear the testimony.  
Mive or six witnessed were examined,  
-but it was &#x27;Impossible to locate any  
;person who admitted seeing the lynch­  
ing. Everybody in the c6mmunity  
was reticent, and the examinati7n of  
the witnesses required only a s&#x27;iort  
-time.  
Sheriff King forwarded a short ro­  
-port from Honea Path to Gov. -Blease..  
In the report he referred the governor  
to the newspaper accounts, which  
the sheriff stated were correct in ev­  
-ery particular, as far as he could de­  
termine.  
&quot;Citizen&quot; Josh Ashley was not a  
witness -of the lynching, and neither  
-was his son, Joe Ashley. These men  
&#x27;left the mob with the negro before the  
&#x27;crowd reached Honea Path. At Honea  
?ath Mayor Sullivan last night plead­  
&#x27;ed that the law be allowed to dis­  
-pose of the negro. He read a tele­  
gram he had received from Gov.  
~Blease, asking that the mob allow the  
law to take its course, stating that  
be would order a special term of cohrt  
to try the negro within two weeks. All

daughter of a preyinent citizen of  
Honea Path, by a negro, Willis Jack­

7.30 o&#x27;clock.  
According to the little girl, she was  
attacked from the rear by the negro

cows, the attack being made within  
three hundred yards of the incorporat­

itively identified as the right man.  
The identification took place while the  
mob was searching the woods, the  
negro having been located in a butch­  
er shop by Constable Haynes. Before  
the mob returned from its fruitiess  
search the negro had been placed in  
an automobile, driven by Melvin Ash­  
ley, and was oi his way to the county  
jail here. About 9.30 o&#x27;clock Jack­  
son was pdged in jail.  
A telephone message from Honea  
Path stated that the angry mob was  
increasing rapidly in numbers and  
that it was likely the crowd would  
-*ome to Anderson to storm the jail.  
Prisoner Rushed to Greenville.  
Sheriff King then barricaded the  
jail, calling in his deputy sheriffs and  
several policemen, who were armed  
with Winchester rifles. Sheriff King  
then hit on the plan of spiriting the  
negro away and in Dr. W. F. Ash­  
more&#x27;s automobile, in charge of Deputy  
Sheriff Martin and Policeman Holland,  
the negro was hurried to Greenville.  
The car carrying the negro left An­  
derson at 12.45 o&#x27;clock. Twenty min­  
utes after the negro had been spirited  
away, more than a hundred heavily  
armed men arrived in the city. Some  
-came on the trolley car, some in au­  
tomobiles and the others on the train.  
They gathered together and proceeded  
toward the county jail. They were  
then told that the prisoner had been  
placed in an automobile and that he  
was then on his way to Greenville.  
dob Continues Pursuit.  
The mob was evidently greatly dis­  
appointed on being outwitted, but un­  
der the leadership of Citizen Josh Ash­  
ley, who had arrived in a large auto­  
mobile, they mobilized again, entered  
automobiles and started in pursuit.  
The officers had departed twenty min­  
.utes in advance. There were a dozen  
-or more automobiles occupied by the  
infuriated crowd.  
T4e distance from Anderson to  
-Greenville is 37 miles and the -roads  
are heavy and muddy on account of a  
hard rain last night. At Piedmont, 22  
miles from Anderson, the mob had  
gained eight minutes On the officers,  
being only 12 minutes belhind them.  
The officers passed -Piedmoit at 1.04  
o&#x27;clock. and arrived at. Greenville at  
1.50 o&#x27;clock.  
The first car of the mot arrived in  
that city just tive minutes later, but at  
that &#x27;time the prisoner was on his way  
to Spartanbu rg. Sheriff King had  
telephoned to Sheriff Poole, at Green­  
ville, and the latter had in readiness

the old machine was made in a twink­  
Itng of an eye -and the big car then

a short report from Honea Path t&lt;

Citizen Joseph Ashley was not a

in two weeks.  
All of the pleading was of no avail,

from Honea Path, was lodged in jail.  
A telephone message from Honea  
Path stated that the angry mob was  
increasing rapidly, and that it was  
likely the crowd would come to Anderson  
to storm the jail. Sheriff King  
then barricaded the jail, calling in his  
deputy sheriff and several policemen  
who were armed with Winchester  
rifles. Sheriff King then hit upon the  
plan of spiriting the negro away, and  
in Dr. W. F. Ashmore&#x27;s automobile,  
in charge of Deputy Sheriff Martin  
and Policeman Holland, the negro  
was dispatched to Greenville. The  
car carrying the negro left Anderson

CL L JL U &quot;X KJ V  
Twenty minutes after the negro  
had been spirited away more than  
100 heavily armed men arrived in  
the city. Some came on the trolley  
car, some in automobiles and the others  
on the train. They gathered together,  
proceeded toward the county  
jail. They were then told that the  
prisoner had been placed in an automobile  
and that he was then on his  
way to Greenville.  
The mob was evidently greatly disappointed  
on being outwitted, but under  
the leadership of &quot;Citizen&quot; Josh  
Ashley, who had arrived in a large  
automobile, they mobilized again,,  
boarded automobiles and started in  
pursuit. The officers had departed 20  
minutes in advance. There were a

&#x27; %  
  
dozen or more automobiles occupied  
by the infuriated crowd.  
Mobs Gained on Officers.  
The distance from Anderson to  
Greenville is 37 miles, and the roads  
are heavy and muddy on account of  
a hard rain last night. At Piedmont,  
22 miles from Anderson, the  
mob had gained eight minutes on the  
officers, being only 12 minutes behind.  
The officers passed Piedmont  
at 1:04 o&#x27;clock, and arrived at Greenville  
at 1:50 o&#x27;clock. The first car  
of the mob arrived in that city just  
five minutes later, but at that time  
the prisoner was on his way to Spartanburg.  
Sheriff King had telephoned  
to Sheriff Poole at Greenville, and  
the latter had in readiness a large  
automobile. A transfer from the old  
machine was made in a twinkling of  
an eye and the big car then started  
for Spartanburg, 40 miles distant.
