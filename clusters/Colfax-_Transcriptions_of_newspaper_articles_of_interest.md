Statements of Steamboatmen  
  
The steamboats John T. Moore and La Bella bring some intelligence of the  
riot at Colfax, in Great parish. The former boat passed that place  
Monday, and the officers state that they saw a large body of colored  
men, armed with shotguns and other weapons, on the bank and they did not  
land. At Montgomery, twenty-five miles above, they had taken on board  
Judge W. R. Rutland, who stated he had been forced to flee from his  
home. He states that Representative Ward had taken armed possession of  
the courthouse at Colfax. Judge Rutland, fearing he would be assasinated  
if he remained there, went to Montgomery and remained there until taken  
on board by the John T. Moore. While away from home he learned that his  
house had been sacked. As the boat passed Colfax it was hailed by Mr.  
Calhoun, but did not take him on board, being unable to make the landing  
on account of the violent wind. On arriving at Alexandria they learned  
the LaBelle, which had passed them, had taken Mr. Calhoun on board, but  
that he had been taken off again under arrest by the sheriff at  
Pineville. At Alexandria were a body of about 200 armed men who were  
going to Colfax to attack the rioteers. These men took a six pound  
cannon from the boat, and proposed to take it with them. They also took  
from the Durfee eleven casks of bacon and twenty barrels of flour. It  
was reported at Alexandria that the rioters were shooting all who  
refused to join them.  
  
The La Bella, coming after the John T. Moore, made a landing a little  
below Colfax, and took Mr. Calhoun on board at Curry Point, very near  
his own plantation. Mr. Calhoun said he had been in the woods since  
Tuesday of last week, that his house had been seized by rioters and he  
was obliged to get away. At Colfax the boat was hailed by a woman. Mr.  
Calhoun states that she was a teacher, from New Orleans, in a private  
family. On reaching Pineville the Belle was boarded by armed men from  
Alexandria, who took Mr. Calhoun off with them. They told him no harm  
would come to him if he was innocent, as he said he was, of creating the  
riot. He was searched, and a letter found on him from Representative  
Ward to Governor Kellogg, reciting the existing disturbance and asking  
for assistance. The Belle was obliged to come down and leave Mr. Calhoun  
in their hands, and it is feared he will suffer violence. The cause of  
the riot seems to be the duplicate commission of the parish officers.  
Governor Kellogg had, at the instigation of Rutland, and others,  
commissioned Nash sheriff, and others who ran on the Fusion ticket. Some  
of those on this ticker were of the party who are charged with having  
burned the house of Judge Phillips and murdered Recorder White September  
25, 1871. Mr. Ward represented these facts to Governor Kellogg, who  
thereafter issued other commissions of the elected republicans. Mr. Ward  
took the commissions, went to Grant and demanded the offices. He was  
refused possession of the courthouse and then took it. Richardson and  
Rutland, who, it is alleged, had been in communication with the puny  
woods Democrats, sent to them for assistance to remake the offices. Mar.  
Ward then ordered Rutland and RIcharsonto leave town. Dr. Cockrell and  
Mr. Paul, the Fusion candidate for sheriff, are leading the men from  
Alexandria, who are going to Grant to fight. It is believed that they  
will be reinforces from the parishes of Catahoula,  
  
Natchitoches, Sabine, Winn, and Rapides. Hadnott, the member of the Odd  
Fellows&#x27; Hall Legislature, is said to be among the active members of the  
bands from piney woods.  
  
Statement of Judge Rutland  
  
Judge W. R. Rutland, who arrived here yesterday morning on the steamboat  
John T. Moore furnishes the Picayune with the following version. In  
reference to the statement that he wrote a letter to the New Orleans  
REPUBLICAN, which we refused to publish, we can only say we never  
received any communication from him:  
  
The Lynch returning board ignored the election of out parish officers,  
and Mr. Kellogg appointed a set of men to fill the vacancies, but who  
did not qualify according to law, and allowed the time to elapse in  
which they are required by law to do it in. Mr. Kellogg, at my instance,  
commissioned all officers who were elected, including both Republicans  
and Fusionists, white and colored, except a parish judge who had already  
qualified and was a Republican.  
  
Wars, a member of the Dryades street Legislature, learning that Mr.  
Kellogg was going to issue these commissions, hastened to Colfax and  
took violent and forcible possession of the courthouse and offices with  
a mob. There was a proposition to hold a mass meeting of the people for  
the purpose of expressing their condemnation in a quiet wat at the  
course pursued by these men, but when the day arrived for the meeting to  
thave been called together there were such violent demonstrations made  
by Ward, Register and Flowers, and the armed band that was backing them,  
that the few white people who had the matter in hand did not pretend to  
do anything, but quietly returned to their homes without going near the  
courthouse, or assembling anywhere. After this I was advised by my  
friends to seek safety, as my life was in danger. I took their advice  
and started to cross the river to Mr. J.C. Morantini&#x27;s place, but when I  
got to the river I was interviewed by another friend, who told me that  
it would not be safe for me to return to this side of the river that  
night. After crossing the river I was met again by persons who told me  
there was a determination to assassinate me if I returned to the Colfax  
side of the river.  
  
At twelve o&#x27;clock at night I found out that the mob had sacked my house  
and that they were going to attempt to cross the river and arrest me. I  
made my escape by Mr. Morantini furnishing me with a horse and guide,  
and I went to Montgomery, where I found my family, which had preceded me  
by boat. Since that time I have been quit and have done nothing,  
remaining at Montgomery. I did not go out of town at all until I got on  
board the steamboat John T. Moore to come to his place. In passing  
colfax, last monday morning, I was discovered on board of the boat by  
the mob of negroes, and my ears were greeted with prolonged and horrific  
yells from the shore, and many, mounting theri horses, got their guns  
and pursued after the boar from some distance, some even following a  
distance over seven miles.  
  
I will state also that on the way down, the boat was hailed to take a  
Mr. Calhoun on , but she could not make the landing owing to a very  
violent wind that was blowing at the time. The steamboat La Belle came  
along directly after, and made the landing, and took Calhoun on, and  
passed us before we got to Alexandria. When we got to Alexandra I  
learned that Calhoun had been arrested and had been taken off of the  
boat. The gentlemen who took him from the board stated that they were  
going to take him to Colfax and make him quit to mischief and restore  
the peace that he was the promoter and head cause of, as he was  
principally responsible for what had been. But I do not believe  
(although, of course, I did not see the persons who had him in custody)  
that any violence against him was meditaded; but it is hard to say what  
an angry set of men will do under such circumstances. I have good  
evidence to believe that the destruction to my property resulted from  
the failure to assassinate me, which has been premeditated.  
  
The white people in Grant parish and in adjoining parishes were  
assembling to resist the encroachments of these men. Ward and his  
desperadoes have been and doubtless are now prowling about the country,  
taking houses, guns and whatever else they could lay their hands upon.  
Ward and his men about a week ago, killed two peaceable colored men, and  
a perfect reign of terror is now instituted in Colfax. This is the first  
statement for any newspaper that I have made, except for a letter I  
wrote to the New Orleans REPUBLICAN, which they refused to publish.  
  
I will state that all my personal property has been taken away and  
destroyed; that the coffin spoken of contained the body of a littler  
girl, who died in Lake Charles in 1867, which I had taken up and was  
going to reinter in Red River, and that I legend in Alexadnria, as I  
came through on Monday, that a negro mob had taken it out and burned. A  
great many colored men were in Alexandria, who had run away from Colfax  
to keep out of the trouble

STATEMENT OF JUDGE RUTLAND.  
Judge W. U. Rutland, who arrived here  
yesterday morning on the steamboat John  
T. Moore, furnishes the Pienyunt with the  
following version. In reference to the  
statement that he wrote a letter to the New  
Orleans Republican, which we refused to  
publish, w e can only say we never received  
  
any communication from him:  
The Lynch returning board ignored tho  
election of our parish officers, and Mr. Kel­  
logg appointed a set of men to till the va­  
cancies, but who did not qualify according  
to law, aud allowed the litne to elapRO in  
which they are required by law to do it  
in. Mr. Kellogg, at my instance, commis­  
sioned all officers who were elected, includ­  
ing both Republicans and Fusioniats, white  
and colored, except a parish judge who had  
already qualified and was a Republican.  
Ward, a member of the Drvades street  
Legislature, learning that Mr. Kellogg was  
goiug to issue these commissions, hastened  
to Colfax and took violent and forcible pos­  
session of the courthouse and offices with »  
mob. There was a proposition to hold a  
mass meeting of the people for the purpose  
of expressing their condemnation in a  
quiet way at the course pursued by these  
men, but when the day arrived for the  
meeting to have been called together  
there were such violent demonstrations  
made by Ward, Register and Flowers, anil  
the armed band tnat was backing them,  
that the lew white people who had  
the matter in hand did not pretend  
to do anything, but quietly returned to thear  
homes without going near the courthouse,  
or assembling anywhere. After this I was  
advised by friends to seek safety, as my

started to cross the river to Mr. J. C.

river 1 was interviewed by another friend,  
who told ine that it would not be safe for  
me to return to tliiw «ioeof the river that  
night. Alter crossing the river I ara# met  
again by person# who told ote there was a  
determination to assassinate Ine if 1 re­  
turned to the Colfax side of the river.  
At twelve o&#x27;clock wt night { found out  
that the mob had sacked my house aud that  
they were going to attempt to cross the  
rive- anti arrest me. I made my escape by  
Mr. Morantim furnishing me witli a nurse  
and guide, and 1  
where I found iny family, which had pre­  
ceded tue by boat. Since that time 1 have  
been quiet and have done nothing, remain­  
ing at Montgomery, i did not go out ot  
town nt all until I got on board of the  
steamboat John T. Moore to come to this  
place. In passing Colfax, last Mond ty

the bout was bailed to take t# Mr. Calhoun  
on, but she could hot make tha landing,  
owing to a very violent wind that was blow­

to be the duplicate commissioning of the  
parish officers. Governor Kellogg had, at  
the instigation of Rutland and others, com­  
missioned Nash sheriff, and others who ran  
on the Fusion ticket Some of those oa this  
ticket were of the party who are charged  
with having burned the house of Judge  
Phillips and murdered Recorder White  
on September 25tb, 1871. Mr.  
Ward represented these facts to  
Governor Kellogg, who thereupon issued  
  
other commissions to the elected Republi  
  
etna. Mr. Ward&#x27;.took the commissions,  
went to Grant parish and demanded the

Rutland and Richardson to leave town. Dr.
