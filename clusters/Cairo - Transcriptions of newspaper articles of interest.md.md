The Lynching of James  
  
James was killed and burned after he confessed the murder of the  
shopgirl and implicated another negro Salzner had nothing whatever to  
do with this crime He was in a cell charged with the murder of his wife  
and his lynchign was merely a sacrifice to the mob s blood lust  
  
The mob that hanged James was led by women many of the wives of  
influential residents of Cairo The rope was pulled taut by female  
relatives of MIss Pelley aided by several score of their sex As the  
negro was pulled into the air these same women sand and screamed with  
delight  
  
The men were for the most part spectators until the rope that was  
strangling the negro and his dying body fell to the ground THen hundred  
of revolvers flashed and 500 bullets crashed into the quivering form of  
the negro The riddled dead man was then dragged through the principal  
streets of the city to the spot where the Pelley girl was assaulted and  
slain  
  
Women applied the torch to the bonfire that had been prepared and into  
which the body of James was thrown Then thousands cheered and danced at  
the scene  
  
James was lynched from an arch int the most conspicuous portion of the  
city at Eighth and Commercial streets Women and children living in the  
outlying sections of the town elderly ladies and even church workers  
gathered at the square and witnessed the hanging  
  
James pleaded piteously for his life but his cries were drowned in the  
shout of derision from the men and the higher toned screams of the  
women Before the rope was pulled James implicated Arthur Alexander  
another negro in the attack on Miss Pelley No sooner the other black s  
name been mentioned than a large part of the mob detached itself gave  
up the pleasure of seeing James dangling in the air and started off to  
look for Alexander  
  
James Implicates Alexander  
  
James was found about 5 o clock Thursday afternoon and the news was  
spread along the line to the scattered mob to board the Big Four train  
and meet them at Belknap The whole party arrived at Cairo on the Big  
Four train at 7 45 and the negro was taken off at Tenth street and  
marched right through the principal streets of the city to the most  
public location under the city arch at Eighth and Commercial streets  
While in custody of the mob at Belknap and coming down on the train the  
negro would not tell about the crime but when he stood under the arch  
he weakened and confessed and said Arthur Alexander who was arrested  
Tuesday in East St Louis and afterwards released was implicated in  
the crime  
  
The mob cae very near getting off the train before it reached Cairo and  
lynching James but it was finally decided to take the negro into Cairo  
and give the people a chance there to help with the work  
  
The mob was so large that the resistance of the officers was fruitless  
The negro James had been in Cairo off and on for several years He came  
from the South He said before being lynched that the assault on the  
girl had been committed before being murdered and that Arthur Alexander  
had helped him with the crime and that Alexander had some of her  
jewelry and effects He admitted that he had outraged MIss Pelley before  
killing her

police he returned to Cairo and was arrested and held b

 Salzner and His Crime  
  
Henry Salzner the white man who was lynched at 11 40 o clock by the  
mob was a photographer by trade and son of William Salzner a Cairo  
hide and wool buyer  
  
The public was incensed against him and while a part of the mob was  
scouring the city for the negro Alexander time hung heavy on the hands  
of the balance of the mob and when some one suggested Salzner the mob  
rushed for the county jail where the man wanted was held in the steel  
cage  
  
The sheriff and his crowd of deputies were pushed aside and the  
battering down of the door of the cage was at once begun with a sledge  
hammer that had been secured  
  
The mob found some difficulty in breaking the cage as it is an entirely  
steel structure but after a half hour of telling blows upon the door  
it give way and Salzner was taken The mob rushed in out of the back  
door of the jail  
  
The mob gave Salzner a chance to confess after the rope was around his  
neck but he was so frightened that he could only mumble that his  
sisters did the killing  
  
They became furious at this and it was hard work to keep them off  
Salzner long enough to give him a chance to pray The mob finally  
subsided and a short religious service for the benefit of Salzner s soul  
was held in a businesslike manner after which he was strung up the  
rope being placed over a telegraph pole at Twenty first and Washington  
streets  
  
It is said Salzner gave his wife no money for food for herself and two  
small babies One night last July Salzner s wife was found at her home  
with her head broken in and a bloody ax was found under the bed the two  
babies playing in the blood Salzner had been seen by neighbors about  
the house early evening and after the crime was discovered Salzner was  
found at the home of his mother where he often sleep at night All  
evidence pointed to Salzner as the murderer of his wife and after the  
crime was discovered Mrs Salzner recovered enough to accuse her husband  
of the crime

marks at the funeral Father J J Downey spoke as follows  
  
What shall I say to express your thoughts your grief and the sorrow  
that overwhelms you today What shall I say in the presence of those  
honored remains to bring some consolation to so many broken hearts  
  
What shall I say to express the sorrow of the people for this terrible  
crime  
  
On Monday last everything was peace and happiness In a few hours the  
hand of the assassin intervened and everything was turned into confusion  
and grief  
  
Cairo has been unfortunate for the last two or three years We have had  
here a series of abominable crimes Human blood has flowed through the  
streets on more occasions than one Widows and orphans cry aloud for  
redress but cry in vain and why  
  
Unhappy and unfortunate is the community that does not respect the laws  
of the land and permit me to tell you that the laws will not be  
respected unless they are enforced Honest judges and honest juries  
constitute the foundation of the peace and happiness of a people because  
they have the administration of the law and when the law is justly  
administered then it commands respect Then every citizen bows his head  
to the majesty of the law Nothing confers a more salutary effect on a  
community than the strict and just administration and strict observance  
of the law Let every citizen take an interest in civic affairs support  
men with honest convictions men who will punish every offender Then  
our homes and our people are safe Then we can breathe the free air of  
liberty and safety Such dreadful crimes as that of Monday will be  
unknown to our people Confidence will be restored virtue will be  
respected and peace and security will again reign in our midst  
  
The world has nothing superior to a virtuous and upright young lady She  
is the light and comfort of the home She is the consolation of parents  
she is the guardian angel of the family She is the pride and honor of  
companions  
  
Her words her actions her ideas kindle truth and affection in all  
hearts and my dear friends you will hear me out such a young lady was  
Miss Pelley She was a credit to any home From the very day that she  
became a member of this congregation until the hour when she was struck  
down by the wretched assassin her conduct was such as any congregation  
might feel proud She represented that splendid class of young ladies  
who make their living by honest effort and endeavor She had the  
intestimable advantage of good home training and she certainly was true  
to the traditions of her home

James was found about 5 o&#x27;clock this  
afternoon and the news was sent along  
the line to the scattered mob to board the  
Big Four train and meet the party with  
the prisoner at Belknap, which was done.  
The negro was taken off at Tenth street  
and marched through the principal streets  
of the city to the arch at Eighth and  
Commercial streets. While In custody of  
the mob at Belknap, and coming down on  
the train, the negro would not tell about  
the crime, but when he stood under the  
arch he weakened and said Arthur Alex­  
ander was implicated in the crime.  
The body was burned at the spot where  
the crime was committed while a crowd of  
10,000 looked on and danced in glee. The  
mob came very near getting off the  
train before it reached the city and lynch­  
ing Janies, but it was finally decided to  
bring the negro into Cairo and give the  
people here a chance to help with the  
work. The mob was so large here that  
the resistance of the officers was fruit­  
less.  
Negro’s Confession.  
The negro James has been in Cairo off  
and on for several days. He came here  
from the south. He said before being  
lynched that an assault had been com­  
mitted on the girl before she was mur­  
dered and that Arthur Alexander helped  
him with the crime.  
Mayor Parsons has sent to Springfield  
for state troops. Relatives of the mur­  
dered girl helped with the lynching and  
they were backed up by a big crowd of  
women.  
Miss Pelley was an orphan girl 22 year

July with an axe, was taken out  
of the county jail at 11:40 by the  
mob and hanged to a telegraph pole  
and his body riddled with bullets.  
The lynching followed closely that of  
James.  
  
The mob had difficulty in breaking  
into the steel cage in the jail, but af­  
ter half an hour of telling blows up­  
on the door, it gave way. Salzner was  
secured and the mob rushed himi out

pray. Finally a short religious serv­

Cairo, the son of a hide and wool buy­

his wife and Is said to have not sup­

Salzner&#x27;s wife was found at her

Patrick&#x27;s church yesterday morning Rev. Father Downey spoke as  
follows:  
What shall I say to express your thoughts, your grief, and the  
sorrow that overwhelms you today? What shall I say in th pres­  
ence of those honored remains to bring some consolation to so many  
broken hearts?  
What shall I say to express the sorrow of the. people for this  
terrible crime? &#x27;  
On Monday last everything was peace and happiness. In a few  
hours the hand of the assassin intervened and everything was turned  
into confusion and grief. &#x27; &#x27; ! , &#x27;  
Cairo Has been unfortunate fcr the las two or three years. We  
have had here a series of abomliuble crimes. Human blood ha flowed  
through the streets on more occasions than one. Widows and or­  
phans cry aloud for redress, but cry in vain and why?  
Unhappy and unfortunate Is the community that does not re­  
spect the laws of the land, and permit me to tell ycu that the laws  
will not be respected unless they are enforced. Honest judges and  
honest juries constitute the foundation of the peace and happiness  
of a people because they have the administration of the law, and  
when the law is justly administered, then it commands respect.  
Then every citizen bows his head to the majesty of the law. Noth­  
ing confers a more salutary effect on a community than the strict  
just administration and strict .observance of the law. Let every citi­  
zen take an interest in civic affairs; support men who are Interested  
In the welfare and reputation of the city; support men with hon­  
est convictions, men who will pinish every offender. Then our  
hcmeii and our. people are safe. Then we can breathe the free air of  
liberty and safety. Such dreadful crimes as that of Monday will be  
unknown to cur people. Confidence will be restored, virtue will be  
respected, and peace and security will reign in our midst.  
The world has nothing superior to a virtuous and upright young  
lady. She Is the light and comfort of the home. She Is the consola­  
tion of parents, she is the guardian angel of the family. She is the  
pride and honor of companions.  
Her words, her actions, her lc&quot;eas, kindle truth and affection in  
all hearts, and my dear friends, yfu&#x27; will bear me out, such a young  
lady was Miss Pelly. She was a credit to any home. From the very  
day that she became a member, of this congregation until the hour  
when the was struck down by the wretched assassin, her conduct  
was such as any congregation m&#x27;ght feel proud. She represented  
that splendid class of young ladht who make their living by honest  
effort .and endeavor. She had t-e inestimable advantage of good  
home training, and she certainly was true to the traditions of her  
home. :

The sheriff said that after leaving the  
train at Dongola he made an effort to  
secure a rig, but found it impossible  
as the farmers knew the crime the ne­  
gro had committed and they refused  
him assistance. He was scarcely able  
to get anything to eat. At every point

board a train he was confronted by

benefit of Selzner&#x27;s soul was held, aft­  
er which he was strung up, the rope  
being placed over a telegraph pole at  
Twenty-first and Washington streets.  
  
Salzner was born and raised here,  
being the son of William Salzner, a  
hide and wool buyer. Salzner had been  
&#x27;married about two years. It was  
nown that he had had trouble with  
is wife and it is said gave her no  
oney for food for herself and two  
mall babies.  
  
One night last July Mrs. Salzner  
was found at her home with her skull  
fractured and a bloody ax was found  
under the bed. The two babies were  
playing in the blood. Salzner had been  
seen by neighbors about the house  
early in the evening and after the  
crime was discovered Salzner was  
found at the ho^ne of his mother,  
where he often slept at night.  
  
All evidence pointed to Salzner as  
ithe slayer of his wife, and after the  
(prime was discovered Mrs. Salzner re­  
covered enough to accuse her husband  
of the crime. The public was incens­  
ed against him, and while a part of  
the mob was scouring the city for the  
negro Alexander, time «hung heavy on  
the hands of the balance of the mob  
and when some one suggested Salzner  
the mob rushed for the county jail,  
•where the man wanted was held in a  
steel cage.

One night last July, Salzucr&#x27;g wife was  
found at her home with her skull fractured  
and a bloody axe was found under the bed.  
The two babies were playing In the blood.  
Salzner had been seen by neighbors about  
the house early In the evening and after  
the crime was discovered Sultrier was  
found at the home ot his mother, where he  
often slept at night.  
All evidence pointed to Salzner as the  
Blayer of his wife, and after the crime was  
discovered Mrs. Salzner recovered enough  
to accuse her husband of the crime. The  
public was incensed against him, and while  
a part of the mob was scouring the city  
for the negro, Alexander, time hung heavy  
on the hands of the balance of the mob  
and when someone suggested Salzner, the  
mob rushed for the county Jail, where the  
man Wanted was held in a steel cage.  
The sheriff and his crowd of deputies  
were pushed aside, and the battering down  
of the door of the cage was at once be­

secured.  
The mob found some difficulty In break

of about sixteen miles.  
When found by the mob the ne­

been married about two years. It waa  
known that he had had trouble with his  
wife, and, it Is said, gave her no money  
for food for herself and two small boys.   
The public was Incensed against him,

of the court house, up to Twenty-first  
street, which Is a prominent corner, and  
has a public square, and where there  
was room enough to hold the crowd.   
Salzner was so badly frightened that he  
was little more than a crazy man. He  
cried and begged piteously for his life,  
and was answered by cries and blows  
from the mob.

Safener&#x27;s Alleged Crime.  
One night, last July, Salzner&#x27;s wife  
was found at her home with her skull  
fractured and a bloody ax was found  
under the bed. The two babies were  
playing in the blood.  
  
All evidence pointed to Salzner as  
the slayer of his wife and after the  
crime was discovered Mrs. Salzner re­  
covered enough to accuse her husband  
of the crime. The public was in­

the negro, Alexander, time hung heavy

Sheriff Davis pleaded for the life of  
the negro, but without avail and when  
Cairo was reached Davis was taken in  
charge by a part of the mob, while  
the rest rushed the negro rapidly to  
the scene of action.  
The mob after the negro grew so  
large that it took in the entire coun­  
try from Karnak to Venice, Ill., a dis­  
tance of about 16 miles.  
The mob was so large here that the  
resistance of the officers was fruitless.  
The negro, James, has been in Cairo  
off and on for several years. He came  
here from the South. He said before  
being lynched that the assault had been  
committed on the girl before being  
murdered and that Arthur Alexander

WHITE MAN SECOND VICTIM.  
Blood Thirsty Mob Doesn&#x27;t Draw the  
Color Line.  
Henry Salzner, a white man, and a  
photographer by trade, who killed his  
wife last July, with an ax, was taken  
out of the county jail at 11:40 o&#x27;clock  
by the mob and hanged to a telegraph  
pole and his body riddled with bullets.  
This lynching followed closely that  
of Will James, a negro, earlier in the  
evening.  
The mob gave Salzner a chance to  
confess after the rope was around his  
neck, but he was so frightened that he  
could only murmur that his sisters did  
the killing.  
The mob grew restless after this and  
it was hard work to keep them off of  
Salzner long enough to give him a  
chance to pray. The mob finally sub­  
sided and a short religious serivce for  
the benefit of Salzner&#x27;s soul was held,  
after which he was strung up, the rope  
being placed over a telegraph pole at  
Twenty-first and Washington streets

was taken out of the county jail at  
11:40 by the mob and hanged to a  
telegraph pole; then his body was  
riddled with bullets. The lynching  
followed closely that of James.   
The mob had difficulty in breaking  
into the steel cage in the jail, but  
after half an hour of telling blows  
upon the door it gave away. Salzner  
secured the mob rushed him out the  
back door of the jail, which is in the  
basement of the court house, around  
the building into Washington avenue  
up to Twenty-First street, a promi­  
nent corner, where there was room  
enough to hold the gaping crowd.   
  
Salzner was given a chance to con­  
fess after the rope was put around  
his neck, but was so frightened that  
he only mumbled that his sisters did,  
the killing.   
The mob became furious at this.  
It was hard to keep them off long  
enough to give Salzner a chance to  
pray. Finally a short religious serv­  
ice was held and then Salzner was  
hanged, the rope being placed over a  
telegraph pole. Salzner was a native  
of Cairo, the son of a hide and wool  
buyer. It was known that he had  
trouble with his wife and it was said  
that he had not supported her and  
her two babies.   
  
Salzner’s wife was found in the  
home with her skull fractured and a  
bloody axe under the bed. Salzner

reported to Governor Deneen by tele­  
phone from Springfield at 1 o’clock  
this morning that at least three com­  
panies of the fourth regiment were  
enroute to Cairo, and that the Carbon­  
dale company would reach the scene  
at 2 o’clock.   
“The entire fourth regiment will  
be there in the morning.” said the  
governor.   
  
“I will not tolerate any quibbling  
with such, lawlessness.”   
According to the governor’s infor­  
mation the mob broke into the jail  
in search of Alexander. When they  
did not find Alexander, they took  
Salzner.   
Chicago, Nov. 12.—Governor Deneen  
telephoned the sheriff at Cairo at  
eleven last night and learned that  
troops were needed at once to pre­  
vent an outbreak.   
“The streets are filled with people  
and they are crazy,” the sheriff re­  
ported to the governor, who was at  
his room in Union League club. “They  
are storming the jail now and trying  
to batter down the doors. I called  
for volunteers to help suppress riot­  
ing, not a soul would help me. 1  
must have troops.”   
The governor, who already had or­  
dered all the militia companies of  
southern Illinois to be held in readi­  
ness, told the sheriff to utilize the  
militia company at Cairo immediately  
and that he would rush further troops  
to the scene.   
  
“I have ordered companies from  
Carbondale and Effingham, to proceed  
to Cairo with all possible speed,” said  
Governor Deneen. “Other companies  
have been ordered to assemble imme­  
diately and all preparations made tor  
their transportation to Cairo and to  
go as soon as I get further word from  
the sheriff.   
  
“When I first heard of the lynching  
and rioting I immediately called up  
Cairo on the telephone but could not  
get the sheriff. I talked to the police  
sergeant who told me everything was  
quiet and the mob dispersed.

James, a negro, and Henry Salzner, a  
white man, were lynched here by an  
infuriated mob of 5000, and more  
hangings are to follow as a result of  
the murder of Anna Pelley last Mon­  
day. James was killed and burned af  
ter he had confessed the murder of  
the shopgirl and implicated another  
negro. Salzner had nothing whatever  
- to do with the crime. He was in a  
cell charged with wife murder and his  
lynching was merely a sacrifice to the  
&#x27; mob&#x27;s blood Inst.  
Tbe&#x27;mob that hanged James was led  
by women, many of them the wives of  
inflnencial residents of Cairo. The  
tfope was palled tajjht by female rela-1  
tives of Miss Pelley, aided by several  
score of their sex. As the negro was  
pulled up into the&#x27; air, these same  
women sang and screamed in delight.  
The men were for the most part  
anectators until the rope that was  
strangling the negro broke and his dy­  
ing body fell to the ground. Then  
hundreds of revolvers flashed and 500  
bullets crashed into the quivering form  
of the negro. The fiddled dead man  
was then dragged through the princi  
pal streets of the city to the spot where  
the Pelley girl was assaulted and slain.  
Womm applied the torch to the bonfire  
that had been prepared and into which  
the body of James was thrown., Then  
thousands cheered and danced at the  
scene. &quot;  
Henry Salzner, a white man and  
photographer by trade, who &#x27;killed his  
wife last July with an axe, was taken  
out of the county jail at 11 :40 by the  
mob and hanged to a telegraph pole  
, and his body riddled with bullets. The  
mob gave Salzner a chance to confess  
after the rope was around his neck,  
but he was so frightened that tie could  
only mumble that his sisters did the  
killing. The mob became furious at  
this, and it was hard work to keep  
them off Salzner long enough to give  
him a chance to pray. The mob final­  
ly subsided and a short religious ser­  
vice for the benefit of Salzner&#x27;s soul,  
was held in businesslike manner, after  
which he was strung up, the rope be­  
ing placed over a telegraph pole at  
Twenty-first and Washington streets
