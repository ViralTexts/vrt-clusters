Wilmington N C Nov 10 This has been a turbulent day in Wilmington  
Race war and revolution have held carnival Early this morning a body of  
fully 1 000 representative white men destroyed the office building and  
plant of the negro daily newspaperm the Record and would have  
lynched the editor had he not previously left the city A few hours  
later a fight arose between white guards by whom every block inhabited  
by white people was being patrolled and a mob of several hundred  
negroes Pandemonium reigned Six negroes were killed and twenty  
wounded The Mayor S P Wright Chief of Police J C Melton and the  
Board of Alderman a fusion negro régime became terrorized and  
resigned Under the direction of a Citizens Committee successors were  
elected so that now ex Congressmen A M Waddell is Mayor Edgar C  
Parmalee Chief of Police and a new Board of Aldermen has assumed the  
reins of government  
  
Peace and order have been restored and five hundred special policemen  
many mounted and on bicycles are patrolling the streets About five  
hundred armed citizens and militia from Fayetteville Kingston  
Goldsboro and else where are here to help maintain order The committee  
of twenty five representing the massmeeting of white citizens in the  
execution of the provisions of the resolutions adopted yesterday  
demanding the departure of Editor Mainly from the city and the removal  
of the Record plant were to have received a definite answer to their  
demands from representative negroes at 7 A M to day Chairman A M  
Wadell was to report in front of the Wilmington Light Infantry armory at  
8 o clock At the appointed hour more than five hundred determined white  
citizens merchants lawyers preachers doctors well armed with guns  
and revolvers gathered at the armory And Col Waddell reported that he  
had received no answer from the negroes They waited at the armory until  
almost 9 o clock hoping that an answer complying with their demands  
would be received but none came  
  
The men formed in line four abreast and started on the march to the  
Record office in a thickly populated negro settlement As the long  
column of armed men approached the neighborhood a throng of negroes men  
women and children began to flee in frenzy Very soon scarcely one was  
in sight anywhere When the column reached the building a two story  
frame structure the men were halted and several advanced to the door  
It was locked  
  
A few blows by stalwart men forced it open and about twenty citizens  
entered and within a few minutes the whole plant was wrecked and the  
broken pieces pitched into the street The windows of the house were  
broken out As the numerous fragments were tossed into the street and  
the people recognized what they were exultant shouts wnet up It was a  
long sign The Record Publication Company was cast into the stree  
that the greatest outburst of cheers went up A beaver hat was thrown  
out and quickly torn in pieces as was a life bust cray on likeness of  
Editor Manly  
  
BUILDING SET ON FIRE  
  
When the wrecking was about complete it became evident that the  
building was on fire Smoke was pouring out of the upper windows There  
were shouts of indignation and commands to extinguish the flames but  
the fire spread quickly so that the Fire Department had to be called  
out As the engines and hose reels dashed up several rounds of shot were  
fired by the men who were lined up for more than two squares either way  
The department quickly had the fire under control but not before the  
building was a total wreck The spread of the flames to adjacent  
buildings was prevented  
  
Conservative men very much regret the fire not only because it was  
entirely unneccesarry but endangered a great deal of other property as  
well Close on one side of the building was St Stephen s Church the  
largest and handsomest negro church in the city On the other side with  
only three or four small cottages joined close together between it and  
the burning buildings is Ruth Hall a large and well equipped hall and  
used by negroes Not one of the adjacent buildings was injured  
  
As soon it was apparent that the fire was under control the people left  
the scene and dispersed through the city many of them going on guard  
duty on the various blocks All was quiet until wild rumors with no  
foundation in fact were carried of the negroes More than 500 were at  
work in the cotton compress They were told that their homes were being  
burned They rushed pell mell from their work However by the efforts  
of Messrs James and W H Sprunt the proprietors of the Alexander  
Sprunt Co plant the great majority were stopped and finally  
controlled They left for their homes in small squads  
  
SHOOTING BEGINS  
  
About the time the negroes were calmed news came from the First ward  
over the railroad that a riot was in progress there Large numbers of  
white men boarded the street cars or went on foot to the scene corner  
Fourth and Harnett streets  
  
This was about 11 30 o clock When they reached the scene six negroes  
had already been killed and fully twenty wounded One young white man  
William Mayo was wounded seriously and wo others George Piner and a  
Mr Chadwick were slightly wounded  
  
What gave rise to the trouble was that white guards who were on duty on  
the corner of Fourth and Harnett streets halted a number of negroes who  
showed a threatening manner All of them save one heeded the advice of  
the guards to go away He finally turned as though to move away and he  
suddenly wheeled about and fired at the guards Very quickly several  
rifle balls crashed through his body killling him instantly The ball  
fired by the negro took effect in William Piner s arm Negroes in sight  
quickly darted around corners and in a few minutes one of them rose up  
from behind a fence and fired a rifle seriously wounding William Mayo  
now of Yonkers N Y who was standing on the plazza of his father s  
residence Mr Mayo was here to vote and would have returned home in a  
few days The negro was captured He was in his own yard Two rifles  
were found in his house  
  
A large mob of negroes assembled about a square away and reinforcements  
for the white men having arrived a volley was fired upon them killing  
four and wounding others The negroes quickly retreated  
  
The Wilmington Light Infantry and the naval reserves were called out  
and the rapid fire gun and Hotchkiss one pounder were also hurried to  
the scene A mob of several hundred negroes was gathered on Ninth  
street corner of Nixon but as the military advanced the negroes fell  
back and scattered  
  
When near Sixth and Nixon a shot was fired into naval reserves from a  
negro house A volley of bullets was fired by the military through doors  
and windows killing one negro Six more inmates were camptured and  
escored to jail The house was demolished  
  
With the exception of two or three casualties in remote parts of the  
city this ended the rioting scenes of the day  
  
The news of the conflict spread quickly to neighboring cities and large  
bodies of men arrived during the afternoon from Fayetville and near by  
towns All parts of the city inhabited by white people are guarded  
closely tonight  
  
It is learned to night that the negro who shot Mayo was found secreted  
in the house He was taken out and told to run for his life He started  
off but only advanced a few yards before his body was riddled with  
bullets  
  
A negro named Tom Miller and a white man both of whom had taken a  
prominent part in inciting the negroes to riot were sought for and  
placed in jail Five other negroes were also incarcerrated and several  
banished from the city  
  
The negro policemen who are attached to the force under the old regime  
failed to report for duty to night  
  
A white Republican who has been an energetic negro leader had peremptory  
noties to leave the city which he did after promising never to return  
A large numer of firearms were captured to day from the negroes

The committee of twenty-five men, rep­  
resenting the mass meeting of white cit­  
izens and appointed to execute the pro­  
visions of the resolutions adopted yester­  
day, which demanded the departure of  
Editor Manly from the city and the re­  
moval of the Record plant, was to have  
a definite answer to their demands from  
representative negroes at 7 a. m. today.  
Chairman A. -JI. Waddell was to report  
the answer to the white citizens in front  
of the Wilmington Light Infantry armory  
at S o&#x27;clock.  
Xo Answer lleceive&#x27;d.  
At the appointed hour more than BOO  
determined white citizens, including mer­  
chants, lawyers, preachers and doctors,  
all well armed, gathered at the armory.  
Col. Waddell reported that he had re­  
ceived no answer from the negroes. The  
crowd waited at the armory until almost  
9 o&#x27;clock, hoping that an answer comply­  
ing with their demands would be received,  
but none came.  
The men then formed In line, four  
abreast, and started on the march to the  
Record office, in a thickly populated ne­  
gro settlement. As the long column of  
armed men approached the vicinity many  
negroes men, women and children were  
seen fleeing.  
When the column reached the building,  
a two-story frame structure, the men  
were halted and several advanced to the  
door. It was locked. A few blows forced  
It open, and about twenty citizens enter­  
ed and within a very few minutes the  
whole plant was wrecked and the broken  
pieces pitched Into the street. The win­  
dows of the house were broken out. As  
the fragments were tossed into the street  
shouts went up.  
An Ontbumt of Cheer.  
It was when a long sign, &quot;The Record  
Publication. Company,&quot; was cast Into the  
street that the greatest outburst of  
cheers went up. A beaver hat was thrown  
out and quickly torn in pieces, as was  
a crayon likeness of Editor Manly.  
When the wrecking was about complete  
it became evident that the building was  
on Are. Smoke was rising out of the  
upper windows. There were shouts of In­  
dignation and commands to extinguish  
the flames. But the Are spread quickly,  
so that the Are department had to be  
called out. As the engines and hose reels  
dashed upon the scene, several rounds  
were fired by the men who were lined up  
for more than two squares cither way.

The department quickly had the fire un­

prevent the spread of the flames to ad  
  
jacent buildings. Conservative men very  
much regret the fire, not only because  
it was entirely unnecessary, but endan­  
gered a great deal of other property, as  
well.  
Close on one side of the building was  
St. Stephen&#x27;s Church, the largest and  
handsomest negro church In the city. On  
the other side, with only three or four  
small cottagesjoined close together, be­  
tween it and the burning building, is  
Ruth Hnll, a large and well equippcJ hall  
used by negroes. As soon as It &#x27;was ap­  
parent that the fire was under control,  
the people left the scene and disp?rseJ  
through the city, many of them going on  
guard duty on the arlous blocks.  
NfCroes llantcn tu the Scene.  
All was quiet until wild rumors wera  
cnrrled to the negroes. More than five  
hundred were at work In the cotton  
compress. They were told that &quot;their  
homes were being burned, etc. They  
rushed, pell-mell from their work. How­  
ever, by the heroic efforts of the Messrs.  
James and W. H. Sprunt, the great ma­  
jority were stopped.  
About the time they were gotten under  
control news came from the First ward,  
over the railroad, that a riot was in pro­  
gress there. Largo numbers of armed  
men boarded the street cars, or went  
on foot to the scene at the corner of  
Fourth and Harnett Streets.  
Fully Twenty Wounded.  
This was about 11:30 o&#x27;clock. When  
they reached the scene four negroes had  
already been killed and fully twenty  
wounded. One young white man, William  
Mao, was seriously wounded.  
What gave rise to the trouble was that  
white guards on duty on the corner of  
Fourth and Harnett Streets had halted  
a number of negroes.  
All save one heeded the advice of the  
guards to disperse. He turned as though  
to move away, but suddenly wheeled  
about and fired at a squad of guards. Sev­  
eral rifle balls went through his body,  
killing him instantly. The ball fired by  
the negro took effect In Piner&#x27;s arm.  
Negroes in sight quickly darted around  
corners and In a few minutes one of them  
raised from behind a fence and fired, se­  
riously wounding William Yonkers, who  
was here to vole and would have re­  
turned heme in a few days.  
Another Deadly Volley.  
The negro was captured. He was In  
his own yard and two Winchesters were  
found in his house. Within ten minutes  
he was shot to death. A large mob of ne­  
groes assembled about a square away,  
and, re-enforcements for the whites hav­  
ing arrived, ja volley was fired upon them,  
killing four&#x27;and wounding others. The  
negroes quickly retreated.  
The Wilmington Light Infantry and the  
nival reserves were called out and  
rapid-fire gun and Hotchkiss one-pounder  
were also hurriedly carried to the scene.  
A mob of several hundred negroes was  
gathered on Ninth Street, corner of Nix­  
on, but as the military advanced the ne­  
groes fell back and rapidly scampered.  
The Military Fire.  
When near Sixth and Nixon a shot was  
fired Into the naval reserves from a ne­  
gro&#x27;s house. A volley of bullets was fired  
by the military through doors and win­  
dows, killing one negro. Six more Inmates  
were captured and escorted to Jail. The  
house was demolished.  
With the exception of two or three cas­  
ualties In remote portions of the city,  
this ended the really riotous scenes of the  
day.  
The news of the conflict spread quickly  
to neighboring cities and large bodies of  
men arrived during the afternoon from  
Fayetteville and near-by towns. All sec­  
tions of the city Inhabited by white peo­  
ple are closely guarded tonight.

A committee of 25 citizens was ap­  
pointed to direct the execution of the  
provisions of the resolutions.  
NEWSPAPER OFFICE SACKED.  
A General Fight in Which Ten Ne­  
groes Are Killed.  
The committee of 25 men represent­  
ing the mass meeting of white citizens  
in the execution of the provisions of  
the resolutions adopted Wednesday, de­  
manding the departure of Editor Manly  
from the city and the removal of The  
Record plant, were to have received a  
definite answer to their demands from  
representative -Negroes at 7.30 a. mn.,  
Thursday morning. Chairman A. M.  
Waddell was to epnort the nswer tonthe  
  
white citizens in front of the Wil­  
mington Light infantry armory at 8  
o&#x27;clock.  
At the appointed hour more than 500  
determined white citizens, consisting  
of merchants, lawyers, preachers, doc­  
tors, etc., well armed with guns and  
ievolvers, gathered at the armory, and  
Col. Waddell reported that he had re­  
ceived no answer from the negroes.  
They waited at the armory until almost  
9 o&#x27;clock, hoping that an answer com­  
plying with their demands would be re­  
ceived, but none came. The men then  
formed in line, four abreast, and started  
on the march to the Record office, in a  
thickly populated negro settlement. As  
the long column of armed men approach  
ed the vicinity great crowds of Negroes,  
men, women and children, were fleeing  
this way and that in a perfect frenzy,  
and very soon, scarcely one was in sight  
anywhere. When the column reached  
the building, a two-story frame struc­  
ture, the men were halted, and several  
advanced to the door. It was locked.  
A few blows by stalwart men forced it  
open, about 20 citizens entered, and  
within a very few minutes the whole  
plant was wrecked, and the broken  
pieces pitched into the street. The  
windows of the house were broken out.  
As the numerous fragments were tossed  
into the street, and the people recog­  
nized what they were, exultant shouts  
went up. Yet with it all there was a  
remarkable demonstration of coolness  
and determination. It was when a  
long sign, &quot;The Record Publishing  
Co.,&quot; was cast into the street, that the  
greatest outburst of cheers went up. A  
beaver hat was thrown out and quickly  
torn in pieces, as was a life bust crayon  
likeness of editor Manly. When the  
wrecking was about complete it became  
evident that the building was on fire.  
Smoke was rising out of the upper  
windows. There were shouts of indig­  
natioD and commands to extinguish the  
flames. But the fire spread quickly, so  
that the fire department had to be call­  
ed out. As the engines and hose reels  
dashed upon the scene, several rounds  
were fired by the men who were lined  
up for inore than two squares either  
way. The department quickly had the  
fire under contrui-out not before the  
building was a total wreck-and pre­  
vented the spread of the iamus to adja­  
cent buildings, Conservative men very  
much regret the fire, not only because  
it was entirely unnecessary, bat because  
it endangered a great deal of other pro­  
perty as well. Close on one side of the  
building was St. Stephen&#x27;s church, the  
largest and hand-omest Negro church  
in the city. On the other side, with  
only three or four small cottages, join­  
ed closely together, between it and the  
burning building is Ruth hall, a &#x27;large  
and well equipped hall owned and used  
by Negroes. Happily not a single one  
of the adjacent buildings were injured.  
As soon as it was apparent that the fire  
was under control, the people left the  
scene and dispersed through the city,  
many of them going on guard duty on  
their various blocks.  
All was quiet until wild rumors, with  
no foundation in fact, were carried to  
the Negroes, more than 500, a- work in  
the cotton compress. They were told  
that their homes were being burned,  
etc. They rushed pell mell from their  
work. However, by the heroic efforts  
of Messrs. James and. W. H. Sprunt,  
the proprietors of Alexander Sprunt &amp;  
Sons Co., the great majority of them  
were stopped, and finally so controlled&#x27;  
as to leave for their home in small  
squads.  
About the time the trouble at the  
compress was gotten under control,  
news came from the first ward, over  
the railroad, that a riot was in progress  
there. Large numbers of armed men  
boarded the street car or ran on foot to  
the scene, corner of Fourth and Harnett  
streets.  
This was about 11:30 o&#x27;clock. When  
they reached the scene five Negroes had  
already been killed and fully 20 wound­  
ed; one highly esteemed young white  
man, Mr. William Mayo, was seriously  
wounded and two others, George Piaser  
and a Mr. Chadwick, were slightly  
wounded.  
What gave rise to the trouble was  
that white guards who-were on duty  
on the corner of Fourth and Harnett  
streets, halted a squad of Negroes who  
manifested a threatening air. All of  
them save one heeded the advice of  
the guards to disperse. He finally  
turned as though to move away and  
suddenly wheeled about and fired at the  
squad of guards. Very quickly several  
rifle balls crashed through his body,  
killing him instantly. The ball fired  
by the Negro took effect in Win. Piner&#x27;s  
arm. The Negroes in sight quickly  
darted around corners, and in a few mo­  
meats one of them raised up from be­  
hind a fence anid fired a Winchester  
rifle, severely wounding Win. Mayo,  
now of Yonkers, N. Y., who was stand­  
ing on the piazza of his father&#x27;s resi­  
dence. Mr. Mayo was here to vote and  
would have returned home in a few  
days. The Negro was captured. lie  
was in his own yard and two Winches­  
ters were found in his house. Within  
10 minutes his body was riddled with  
bullets. A large mob of Negroes as­  
sembled about a square away, and rein­  
forcements for the white men having  
arrived a volley was fired upon them  
killing four more and wounding others.  
The Negroes quickly retreated. The  
Wilmingfn Light infantry and the  
naval. reserves were called out and the  
rapid-fire gun and the Hotchkiss one­  
pounder were also hurriedly carried to  
the scene. A mob of several hundred  
Negroes was gathered on Ninth street,  
corner of Nixon, but as the military ad­  
vanced the Negroes fell back and rapid­  
ly scattered.  
When near Sixth and Nixon streets a  
shot was fired into the naval reserves  
from a Negro house. A-volley of bul­  
lets was fired by the military through  
doors and windows, killing one Negro.  
Nine inmates were captured arnd es­  
corted to jail. The house was &#x27;emol­  
ished.  
With the exception of two er three  
casualties in remote portions of the  
city this ended the really riotous scenes  
of the day.  
The news of the conflict spread  
quickly to neigh boring cities and large  
bodies of men arrived during the after­  
noon from Fayetteville and other nearby  
towns, and all sections of the city in­  
habited by white people arc closely  
guarded tonight.--State

of merchants,lawyers, preachBis,

At the appointed hour more than 500 &#x27;  
determined white citizens, consisting  
of merchants, lawyers, preachers, doctors,  
etc., well armed with guns and ,  
le vol vers, gathered at the armory, and .  
Col. Waddell reported that he had re- ,

9 o&#x27;clock, hoping that an answer complying  
with their demands would be received,  
but none came. The men then  
formed in line, four abreast, and started  
on the march tc the Record, office, in a  
thickly populated negro settlement. As  
the long column of armed men approach  
ed the vieinity great crowds of Negroes,  
men, women and children, were fleeing  
this way and that in a perfect frenzy,  
and very soon, scarcely one was insight  
anywhere. When the column reached  
the building, a two-story frame structure,  
the men were halted, aad several  
advanced to the door. It was locked.  
A few blows by stalwart men forced it  
  
open, about 20 citizens entered, and  
within a very few minutes the whole j  
plant was wrecked, and the broken  
pieces pitched into the street. The ?  
windows of the house were broken out. ^  
As the numerous fragments were tossed g  
into the street, and tne people recog- t  
nized what they were, exultant shouts ^  
went up. Yet with it all there was a t  
remarkable demonstration of coolness ^  
and determination. It was when a  
long sign, l,The Record Publishing  
Uo.,&quot; was cast into the street, that the a  
greatest outburst of cheers went up. A ^  
beaver hat was thrown out and quickly j  
torn in pieces, as was a life bust crayon  
likeness of editor Manly. When the  
wrecking was about complete it became  
evident that the building was on lire. Smoke  
was rising out of the upper  
windows. There were shouts of indig- r  
nation and commands to extinguish the  
flames. But the fire spread quickly, so  
that the fire department had to be called  
out. As the engines and hose reels  
dashed upon the scene, several rounds r  
were fired by the men who were lined

say. Tlie department quickly had the r  
fire under comrul?but not before the c  
building was a total wreck?and prevented  
the spread of the flames to adjacent  
buildings. Conservative men very  
much regret the fire, not only because n  
it was entirely unnecessary, but because  
it endangered a great deal of other- property  
as well. Close on one side of the  
building was St. Stephen&#x27;s church, the .  
largest and handsomest Negro church  
in the city. On the other side, with  
only three or four small cottages, join- *  
ed closely together, between it and the i  
burning building is Ruth hall, a large  
and well equipped hall owned and used  
by Negroes. Happily not a single one ?  
of the adjacent buildings were injured.  
As soon as it was apparent that the fire ?  
was under control, the people left the c  
scene and dispersed through the city, ?

various blocks. ^ \
All w+.j quiet until wild rumors, with a  
no foundation in fact, were carried to c  
the Negroes, more than 500, ai work in r  
the cotton compress. They were told B  
that their homes were being burned, c  
etc. They rushed pell mell from their v  
work. However, by the heroic efforts ?  
of Messrs. James and W. H. Sprunt, E  
the proprietors of Alexander Sprunt &amp; E  
Sons Co., the great majority of them B  
were stopped, and finally so controlled j,  
as to leave for their home in small v  
squads. t  
About the time the trouble at the f  
compress was gotten under control, I  
news came from the first ward, over a  
the railroad, that a riot was in progress r  
there. Large numbers of armed men i  
boarded the street car or ran on foot to  
the scene, corner of Fourth and Harnett  
streets.  
This was about 11:30 o&#x27;clock. When 3  
they reached the^ scene five Negroes had *  
already been killed and fully 20 wounded;  
one highly esteemed young white 9  
man, Mr. William Mayo, was seriously ^  
wounded and two others, George Finer 1  
  
and a Mr. Chadwlck, were sligutiy ^  
wounded.  
What gave rise to tHe trouble was  
that white guards who were on duty 1  
on the corner of Fourth and Harnett  
streets,&#x27; halted a squad of Negroes who .  
manifested a threatening a;.r. All of j  
them save one heeded the advice of v  
the guards to disperse. He finally ,  
turned as though to move away and .  
suddenly wheeled about and fired at the v  
squad of guards. Very quickly several t  
rifle balls crashed through his body, j  
killing him instantly. The ball firea j  
by the Negro took effect in Wm. Piner&#x27;s &amp;  
arm. The Negroes in sight quickly .  
i.i i i - n S  
  
aartea arouna corners, ana in a lew moments  
one of them raised up from behind  
a fence and fired a &quot;Winchester  
rifle, severely wounding Wm. Mayo, r  
now of Yonkers, N. Y., who was stand- J&quot;  
ing on the piazza of his father&#x27;s residence.  
Mr. Mayo was here to vote and ?  
would have returned home in a few .  
days. The Negro was captured. He ^  
was in his own yard and two Winches- ,  
ters were found in his house. Within  
10 minutes his body was riddled with v  
bullets. A large mob of Negroes as- e  
sembled about a square away, and rein- ?  
forcements for the white men having ,  
?j it ? j i-i. a  
  
arnveu. a volley was ureu. upuu tucm  
killing four more and wounding others. ?  
The Negroes quickly retreated. The 1  
Wilmington Light infantry and the  
naval reserves vrere called out and the  
rapid-fire gun and the Hotchkiss one- c  
pounder were also hurriedly carried to t  
the scene. A mob of several hundred p  
Negroes was gathered on Ninth street, s  
corner of Nixon, but as the military ad- \
vanced the Negroes fell back and rapid- s  
ly scattered. u  
  
When nearSixtti and iNixon streets a  
shot was fired into the naval reserves  
from a Negro house. A volley of bullets  
was fired by the military through t  
doors and windows, killing one Negro. 11  
Nine inmates were captured and es- e  
corted to jail. The house was demol- fc  
ished. $  
With the exception of two or three t:  
  
casualties in remote portions of the  
city this ended the really riotous scenes  
of the day.  
The news of the conflict spread ?  
quickly to neighboring cities and large j3  
bodies of men arrived during the after- *

towns, and all sections of the city in- *

Wilmington, N. C. (Special.)—Thursday  
was a turbulent day Indeed In Wilmington.  
Eace war and revolution held high carni­  
val. Early In the morning a tody ol fully  
1,000 representative white men destroyed  
the office, building, and plant of the negro  
dally, the Record, and would have lynched  
the editor, had It not been that the latter  
had previously left the city. A few hours  
later a fight arose between white guards, by  
whom every block Inhabited by white peo­  
ple was being patrolled, and a mob of sev­  
eral hundred negroes. Six negroes were  
killed and several white men wounded.  
Mayor S. P. Wright, Chief of Police J. C.  
Melton, and the Board of Aldermen, became  
terrorized and resigned. Under the direct­  
ion of a citizens’ committee successors were  
elected, so that now ex-Congressman A. M.  
Waddell is Mayor, Edgar G. Parmalee  
Chief of Police, and a new Board of Aider­  
men has assumed the reins of government.  
Peace and order have been restored, and  
500 special policemen many mounted, and  
on bicycles, nre patrolling the streets. About  
500 armed citizens and military from Fayet­  
teville, Kinston, Goldsboro, and elsewhere,  
are here to help maintain order.  
The committee of twenty-five men repre­  
senting the mass-meetiug of white citizens  
in the execution of the provisions of the res­  
olutions adopted Wednesday, demanding  
the departure of Editor Manly from the  
city and the removal of the Record plant,  
was to have received a definite answer to  
their demands by representative negroes at  
7.80 n. m. Thursday. Chairman A. M. Wad­  
dell was to report the answer to the white  
citizens in front of the Wilmington Light In­  
fantry Armory at 8 o’clock.  
Wrecked a Newspaper Plant.  
At the appointed hour more than 500 De­  
termined white citizens, comprising mer­  
chants, lawyers, preachers, dootors, Ac.,  
well armed with guns and revolvers,  
gathered at the corner and Col. Waddle re­  
ported that he had received no answer from  
the negroes. They waited at the armory un­  
til almost 9 o’clook hoping that an answer  
complying with their demand would be re­  
ceived, but none came.  
The men formed In line, four abreast, and  
started on the march to the Record office in  
a thickly-populated negro settlement. As  
the long column of armed men approachod  
the vicinity, great crowds of negioes, men,  
womeD, and children, fled this way and that  
in a perfect frenzy, and very soon scarcely  
one was in sight anywhere.  
When the column reached the buildlDg, a  
two-story frame structure, the men were  
baited, and several advanced to the door.  
It was looked. A few blows by stalwart  
men forced it open, and about twenty peo­  
ple entered. Within a very few minutes th.&#x27;,  
whole plant was wreckod, and the broken  
pieces pitched into the street. The windows  
of the house were broken out. As the num­  
erous fragments were tossed into the street,  
and the people recognized what they were,  
exultant shouts went up. Yet with it all  
there was a remarkable demonstration of  
coolness and determination. It was when a  
long sign, the Record Publishing Company,  
was cast into the street, that the greatest  
outburst of cheers went up. A beaver hat  
was thrown out and quickly torn in pieces,  
as was a crayon likenoss of Editor Manlly.  
Building Set Afire and Burned.  
When the wrecking was about complete  
it became evident that the building was on  
Are. Smoke was rising out of the upper  
windows. There were shouts of indignation  
and commands to extinguish the flames.  
But the fire spread quickly, so that the Are  
■department had to be called out. As the  
engines and hose reels dashed upon the  
scene, several rounds were llred by the men  
who were lined up for more than two  
squares either way. The department quick­  
ly had the fire under control, hut not be­  
fore the building was a total wreck, and  
prevented the spread of the flames to adja­  
cent buildings.

Are, not only because It was entirely un­  
necessary, but because it endangered a great  
deal of .other property as well.  
As soon as it was apparent that the Are&#x27;  
was under control the people left the scene  
and dispersed through the oity, many of  
them going on guard duty on their various  
blocks. All was quiet until wild rumors,  
with no foundation in fact, were carried to  
the negroes, more than 500 of whom were at  
work in the cotton compress. They were  
told that their homes were being burned  
out. They rushed pell mell from their  
work. However, by the heroic efforts of  
Messrs. James and W. H. Sprunt, the pro­  
prietors of Alexander Sprunt &amp; Son Com­  
pany, the great majority of them were  
stopped and Anally Induced to leave for  
their homes in small squads.  
Fatal ltioting In the First Ward.  
About the time the trouble at the oom­  
press was gotten under control, news oame  
from the First Ward, over the railroad, that  
a riot was in progress there. Large num­  
bers of armed men boarded the street car  
or ran on foot to the scene, corner of Fourth  
and Harnett streets.  
It was about 11.SO o’olock when they  
reached the scene. Four negroes had al­  
ready been killed and fully twenty wounded.  
One highly esteemed young wbite man,  
William Mayo, waa seriously wounded, and  
two others, George Finer und a Mr. Chad­  
wick, were sllghly wounded. What gave  
rise to the trouble was that white guards,  
who were on duty on the corner of Fourth  
and Harnett streets, halted a number of  
negroes who manifested a threatening air.  
All of them save one heeded the advice of  
the guards to disperse. He Anally turned as  
  
i bough to move away, aud suddenly wheeled&#x27;  
about and flrod at tbe squad of guardsj  
Very quickly several rifle balls crashed  
through his body, kiying him Instantly. !  
The ball fired by the negro took effect In!  
William Plner’s arm.  
The negroes In sight quloklr darted around  
corners, and in a few moments one of them  
fired a Winchester rifle from behind a fence,  
seriously wounding William Mayo, now of  
Yonkers, N. Y., who was standing on the  
piazza of his father’s residence. Mr. Mayo  
was here to vote and would have returned  
home In a few days. The negro was cap­  
tured. He was in his own yurd and two  
Winchesters were found in his house  
Within ten minutes his body was riddled  
with bullets.  
Mob Fired on and Four Killed.  
A large mob of negroes assembled about a  
square away, and re-enforcements for the  
white men having arrived, a volley was fired  
upon them, killing four and wounding oth­  
ers. The negroes then quickly retreated.  
The Wilmington Light Infantry and the  
Naval Reserves were called out and the  
rapid-fire gun and Hotchkiss one-pounder  
were also hurriedly carried to the scene. A  
mob of sevoral hundred negroes gathered  
on Ninth street, corner of Nixon, but as the  
military advanced the negroes fell back and  
rapidly scattered. When near Sixth and  
Nixon streets a shot was Bred into the Naval  
Reserves from a negro’s house. A volley of  
bullets was fired by the military through  
doors and windows, killing one negro. Six  
more Inmates were captured and esoorted  
to jail and the house demolished.  
With the exception of two or three casual­  
Ities in remote portions of the city this  
ended the really riotous scenes of the day.  
The news of the conflict spread quickly to  
neighboring cities and large bodies of men  
arrived during the afternoon from Fayette­  
ville and other nearby towns. All sections  
of the city inhabited by white people are  
closely guarded.

Wero to have received a deflnate an­

dell was to report the answer to tho

&#x27; appointed hour more than five hundred  
determined white citizens, merchants,  
lawyers, preachers, doctors, well arm­  
ed with guns and revolvers, gathered  
at the armory, and Col. Waddell re­  
ported that ho had received no answer  
from the negroes.; They wnlted at the  
armory, Roping that an answer com­  
plying with their demands would bo  
received, but none came.  
lac men formed in line, four abreast,  
and started on tho Inarch to tho  
&quot;ltecord&quot; office, in a thickly populated  
negro settlement, As the long column  
of armed men approached tho neigh­  
borhood a throng of negroes, men, wo  
men nnu ciiiiuren.begau to flee In fren­  
zy. Very spon scarcely one was In  
sight anywhere. When tho column  
reached the building, a two-storj&#x27;  
frame structure, the men were halted,  
and several &#x27;advanced to tho door. It  
was locked.  
A few blo&#x27;ws by stalwart men forced  
It open, and about twenty citizens en­  
tered, and within a few minutes the  
whole plant was wrecked and the brok­  
en pieces pltclwd Into the street. Tho  
windows of the house were broken out.  
As the numerous fragments were toss­  
ed Into the street and the people recog­  
nized what they were exultant shouts  
went up. It was when a long sigu,  
&quot;The Record Publication Company,&quot;  
was cast Into the street that, the great­  
est outbursts of cheers went up. A  
beaver hat was thrown out and quick­  
ly torn to pieces, as was a life bust  
crayon likeness of EditorManley.  
When tho wrecking was about com­  
plete, It becamo evident that the build­  
ing was on fire. Smoke, was pouring  
out of the upper windows. T hero, were  
shouts of Indignation and commands  
to extinguish the flames, but the fire  
spread quickly, so that tho Flro De­  
partment had to be&#x27; called out jis the  
engines and hose reels&#x27;dashed up sever­  
al, rounds of shot were fired by the men  
who were liued up for more than two  
squares either way. Tho department  
quickly had the fire under control, but  
not before the building was a total  
wreck, Tlio spread of the flames to  
adjacent buildings was prevented
