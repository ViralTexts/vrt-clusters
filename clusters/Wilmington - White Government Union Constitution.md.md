PREFACE  
  
Our State is the only community in the world with a majority of white  
voters where the officers selected to administer the Government are the  
choice of negroes and not of the whites  
  
This condition has been brought about by an unfortunate division among  
the white people and it is likely to continue until that division is  
removed and unity again prevails among them as it did prior to 1892  
  
The necessity for a closer union of the white people of the State is so  
apparent that it requires no argument and that necessity has called  
forth the organization of THE WHITE GOVERNMENT UNION

ensuing election, shall be eligible to
