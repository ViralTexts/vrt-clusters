Memphis, Tenn., Sept. 7.-The following report of the riot at Clin- ton, Mississippi, Saturday last was received from Jackson to-night:  
According to wide and extended notice throughout Hinds county a Republican meeting was assembled in Clinton Saturday. Members of nearly all the Republican clubs in the county were in attendance, with many women and children. A bar- becue was announced, and arrange- ments to feed 3000 persons. Nearly that number was in attendance. Every precaution was taken to have an orderly and successful meeting. The Clinton authorities had not appointed any police.  
At 1:30 p.m. the procession filed upon the grounds and speaking commenced, Fifteen minutes af- terwards some Democrats came on the ground and asked for a division of the time in the interest of peace and good feeling. Their request was granted and a joint discussion was had between Johnson, the Dem- ocratic candidate for State Senator, and Captain Fisher, editor of the Jackson Times.  
Johnson spoke over an hour when Fisher took the stand. He regard- this as an auspicious opening of the campaign in the county, and express- ed the hope that the same good feel- ing would prevail in all their meet- ings. He spoke in this strain about eight minutes, when he saw persons on the outskirts of the crowd leav- ing to the scene of a difficulty about fifty yards distant.  
The speaker paused and urged the audience to remain, but excited words drew most of them away and he stopped to await their return. In about three minutes three shots were fired, and in a moment fifty shots seemed to be discharged amid the wildest confusion. Women and children broke and leit in a stam. pede. In the course of fifteen min- utes three whites and several colored men were killed. A large majority of the blacks were unarmed, having been cautioned against carrying weapons to the meeting. The diff- culty was unsought by them, and they acted in self-defense.  
By 5 o&#x27;clock not a colored man was seen on the grounds. Armed whites came out from Clinton and took possession. At the same time the Vicksburg train brought armed men from Edgerton and Bolton. All the colored men they could find were shot down. 120 were killed in cold blood. Armed bands were organized and scoured the country, and the work of slaughter went on.  
It is estimated that fifty men were killed in this, Way county, Sunday. Those who were not killed had to flee to the woods for safety. A complete reign of terror prevails. The civil authorities are utterly powerless to stop the marauding bands. Governor Ames has issued an order commanding the rioters to disperse. The city is full of colored refugees, who dare not return to their homes. They ask nothing but protection.  
Gov. Ames is doing all within his power to prevent further bloodshed. No Sheriff&#x27;s posse is sufficient.

to prevail, and he should say nothing  
that would not contributs to this end.  
Captain Fisher spoke in this strain  
about eight minutes, when he saw the  
outskirts of the crowd leaving to go to  
the scene of a difficulty about fifty yard  
distant. The speaker paused and urged  
the audience to remain, but the excited  
words drew most of them away, and he  
stopped speaking to await their return.  
In about three minutes a pistol shot was  
fired in the crowd, and quickly another,  
and in a moment fifty shots seemed t  
be discharged. The wildest confusion  
ensued; men, women and children were  
running in every direction, and horses  
and mules broke loose from their hitth­  
ings and joined in the stampede. In  
the course of fifteen minutes exceeding  
Five hundred shots  
were fired, three whites and four col­  
ored were killed, and six whites and  
about twenty colored wounded. A large  
majority of the blacks were unarmed,  
having been cautioned against carrying  
weapons to the meeting. The difficulty  
was wholly unsought by them, and they  
fought only in self-defense. By five  
o&#x27;clock not a colored man was seen on  
the grounds. Armed whites came out  
from Clinton and took possession of the  
grounds; at the same time the Vicks­  
burg train brought armed men from Ed­  
wards and Bolton. Saturday night five  
hundred armed white men occupied  
Clinton, and there was  
QUIET SUNDAY MORNING.  
At daybreak the Vicksburgers, two  
hundred of whom were there, com­  
menced slaughtering negroes, and all  
the colored men they could find were  
shot down. A dozen or more were killed  
in cold blood. Armed bands organized  
and scoured the country, and the work  
of slaughter went on there. It is  
estimated that fifty men were killed in  
this way in the country, on Sunday.  
Those who were not killed had to flee to  
the woods and swamps for protection.  
A complete reign of terror possesses the  
county. Colored men for two days have  
been hourly arriving, and reporting new  
outrages. The civil authorities are  
Utterly powerless

The following report of the riot at  
Clinton, Miss., on the 4th inst.. is from  
Jackson:   
According to a wide extended notice  
throughout Hinds county, a mass Repub  
lican meeting assembled at Clinton last  
Saturday. Nearly all the Republicans in  
the county were in attendance, with  
many women and children. A barbecue  
was announced, and arrangements made  
to feed 3.00 ft persons. Nearly this num­  
ber were in attendance. Every precau­  
tion was taken to have an orderly and suc­  
cessful meeting. The Clinton authorities  
had appointed special police, and regular­  
ly prohibited the sale us intoxicating  
liquors. At 1:30 p. m. the procession  
filed upon the grounds and speaking com­  
menced ten minutes after. The Demo­  
cratic speakers Ix-mg on the grounds,  
and asking for a division of time, in the  
interest ot peace and good feel­  
ing, their request was granted, and a  
joint discussion was fixed between Judge  
Johnston, the Democratic candidate for  
the State Senate, and Captain H. Fisher,  
editor of the Jackson Daily 7’iimyr, John­  
ston to speak an hour, Fisher to follow an  
hour and a quarter, and Johnston to  
close iu a quarter &gt;f an hour. Johnston  
made a liberal and courteous speech; and  
Captain Fisher took the stand and con­  
gratulated the audience on the auspicious  
opening of the campaign in the county,  
expressing the hope that the same good  
feeling would characterize all these meet­  
ings. He complimented Johnston on the  
conservative t&lt; ne of his remarks, and  
«aid he would be glad to see such meet­  
ings generally held. The Republican  
party wanted peace to prevail, and he  
should say nothing that would not con­  
tribute to this end.   
  
THE KIGHT COMMENCES.   
Captain Fisher spoke in this strain  
about eight minutes, when he saw the  
outskirts of the crowd leaving to go to  
the scene of the difficulty about fifty  
yards distant. The speaker paused and  
urged the audience to remain, but excited  
words drew the most of them, and he  
stopped speaking to await their return.  
In about three minutes a pistol shot was  
fired in the crowd, and quickly another,  
and in a moment fifty shots were heard  
to be discharged. The wildest confusion  
ensued among the men, women and child­  
ren. Horses broke loose from their  
hitching* and joined the stampede. In  
the course of fifteen minutes exceeding  
500 shots were fired. Three whites and  
four colored men were wounded. A large  
majority of the blacks were unarmed,  
having been eftutioned against carrying  
weapons to the meeting. The difficulty  
was wholly unsought by them, and they  
fought in self defense. By sp.m. no col­  
ored men were seen on the ground.   
Armed whites came out from Clinton  
and took possession of the grounds. At
