Honea Path, Oct. 11: Stiff and Stark, riddled with shots, the lifeless  
body of Willis Jackson is hanging to a telephone post near the scene of  
the crime yesterday morning. The crowd of angry men has had its way. The  
tide of passion which swept all reason, before it has passed, and this  
morning beyond the interest of the curious the town has assumed its  
wonted quiet.  
  
Willis Jackson was arrested at first on suspicion, and because he met  
with the description which the outraged girl gave of her assailant. When  
he was taken before her she positively and without hesitation identified  
him.

committed here. The eleven year old child of one of our citizens  
was the victim of a criminal assault at the hands of a sixteen or  
seventeen year old boy. She had gone to carry this boy to the pasture, a  
quarter of a mile from home about 7.30 o&#x27;clock. She was on one of the  
main roads leading out of town and was seized and dragged into the woods  
about fifty yards where the attack was made, and it is feared that he  
accomplished his devilish purpose in the woods. In the woods there is  
every evidence of a fearful struggle. When the child was seized her  
assailant threatened to kill her if she cried out to give alarm.  
Terrified with fright she desisted from her cries. It is thought that  
the noise of a buggy approaching along the road may have frightened him  
and that he let his victim go. A gentleman from the country saw the  
negro come from the woods and seeing the child muddy and crying  
approached her. The news quickly spread. Willis Jackson was arrested on
