recognized by Mayor Mitchel. Mr.  
Gompers had declared that many la­  
boring men are in much the same posi­  
tions as Russians under the old re­  
gime, and had read a telegram he had  
received tonight from the president of  
the Federation of Labor of Illinois.

HOME-GROWN BARBARISM  
Denial by Samuel Gompers, president of the Ameri­  
can Federation of Labor, that trade unions had had any  
share in the East St. Louis riots, which was met by a ve­  
heinnt denunciation bv Theodore Roosevelt of the murder  
of helpless negroes, precipitated a tumultuous demonstra­  
tion at a mass meeting held in Carnegie hall in New York  
recently in honor of the Russian mission to the United  
States.  
It was at the close of an address by Mr. Gompers that  
pel&#x27;s declared that many laboring men are in much the  
same position as Russians under the old regime, and read a  
the colonel was recognized by Mayor iMtchell. Mr. Gom­  
telgram he said he had received tonight from the president  
of the Federation of Labor of Illinois. This message pur­  
ported to explain the origin of the East St. Louis riots. It  
asserted that instead of labor unions being responsible for  
them, they resulted from employers enticing negroes from  
the South to the city “to break the back of labor.”  
“There should be no apology for the infamous brutal­  
ities committed on the colored people of East St. Louis,”  
declared Mr. Rooseevlt, in beginning his vigorous denun­  
ciation of the riots. “Justice is not a mere phrase. It has  
to be translated into action. How can we praise Russia for  
freeing her people when we must apologize for doing mur­  
der to the helpless?  
“In the past we have listened to the same excuse from  
those in authority in Old Russia for the fearful pogroms  
on the Jews. I will do anything for the laboring men ex­  
cept that which is wrong and that I won’t do for him or for  
any one else. I care not a snap of my finger for a telegram  
from the head of the labor unions of Illinois. Let there be  
the fullest investigation into these murders.”  
Mr. Roosevelt was interrupted by Mr. Gompers, who  
rose from his seat and approached the former president.  
“Why don’t you accuse after an investigation?” the la­  
bor leader demanded.  
  
With these words he returned to his seat. Roosevelt  
strode over to his chair and exclaimed: “Mr. Gompers,  
why don’t I accuse afterwards? I’ll answer now, when  
murder is to be answered.”  
With that the colonel brought down on Mr. Gomper’s  
shouder his open left hand, which he had raised above his  
head.  
At this juncture many of the men on the platform  
leaped to their feet and there was a storm of hisses,  
cheers and “boos” from all parts of the house.  
When Mr. Roosevelt could make himself heard above  
the din he went on:  
“I will go to any extreme to bring justice to the labor­  
ing man, but when there is murder I will put him down.”  
  
“HEY, GEN’RAL, SEND SOME CHOCOLATES TO THE FRONT!”
