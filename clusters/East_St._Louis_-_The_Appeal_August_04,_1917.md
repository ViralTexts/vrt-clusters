The Appeal - August 04, 1917  
  
SATURDAY, AUGUST 4, 1917.  
  
**\&quot;Any prejudice whatever will be insurmountable if those who do not  
share in it themselves truckle to it and flatter it and accept it as a  
law of nature.\&quot; - John Stuart Mill.**  
  
**THE MAN WHO DARES**  
  
**I honor the man who in the consci- entious discharge of his duty dares  
to stand alone; the world, with ignorant, intolerant judgment, may  
condemn, the countenances of relatives may be averted, and the hearts of  
friends grow cold, but the sense of duty done shall be sweeter than the  
applause of the world, the countenances of relatives or the hearts of  
friends. --Charles Sumner.**  
  
**A LITANY OF ATLANTA.**  
  
In September, 1906, there was a brutal massacre of colored people at  
Atlanta, Georgia. Scores of colored men, women and children were mur-  
dered because of their color. Dr., W. E. Burghardt Du Bois wrote the  
story of the massacre in the form of a litany which appeared in the New  
York In- dependent shortly after its occur- rence. It was \&quot;done in the  
day of death.\&quot;  
  
The recent massacre at East St. Louis so resembles the Atlanta mur-  
derfest that we print in this issue Du Bois\&#x27; \&quot;A Litany of Atlanta,\&quot;  
by ex- press permission of the New York In- dependent.  
  
------------------  
  
**CRIME AGAINST CIVILIZATION.**  
  
In the opinion of THE APPEAL, the strongest article denouncing the East  
Saint Louis massacre was an editorial published in the Christian  
Register of Boston, Mass. The Regis- ter is the leading Unitarian paper  
published in the United States and per- haps that accounts for the  
article.  
  
The Unitarian church is one of the few Christian denominations in Amer-  
t ica in which there is no color line. The orthodox Christian sects in  
Amer- ica are so filled with prejudice that the ruthless massacre of  
helpless men, women and children fails to bring out a protest.  
  
The article from the Christian Reg- ister, which follows, is not so long  
as some of the articles which have ap- peared in the daily papers, but  
it is evidently the most sincere which THE APPEAL has seen:  
  
The hideous outrage against law and humanity in East St. Louis, Ill.,  
makes us turn again from the barbari- ties of war to the ferocities of  
peace, from crimes against civilization abroad to crimes against  
civilization at home. The testimony of eye witnesses shows that nothing  
is to be learned among white people of this city from the cru- elties  
and brutalities of foreign con- quest. No tribes of any name or time  
have ever outdone the white men and women who burned colored men, women  
and children the other day in this American city. Nothing more re-  
volting was ever charged against Ne- groes than was done by these white  
people. The organization of the man- hood of the nation for the  
protection of human life and liberty on the seas and for the deliverance  
of democracy in the world will be needed at home. after its task abroad  
is done. While our fellow-creatures in the United States are hunted and  
tortured as if they were wild beasts, government can scarcely be called  
democratic. So long as colored people are proscribed, dis- criminated  
against, segregated and despised, ill-will and antipathy will furnish  
fertilizers of hatred and mur- der.  
  
------------------  
  
**WARNS AGAINST RACIAL HATRED.**  
  
It is so unusual for a Christian minister to preach against racial hat-  
red that THE APPEAL is pleased to note that one minister has the cour-  
age of his convictions.  
  
In his sermon last Sunday, Rev. H. E. Peabody, pastor of the South Con-  
gregational Church, in Chicago, said that racial hatred within the  
United States is more dangerous than all Ger- mans outside this country.  
  
Dr. Peabody likened the East St. Louis massacre to the \&quot;atrocities of  
the unspeakable Turk in Armenia.\&quot;  
  
\&quot;The country\&#x27;s perils are not all on the sea and beyond,\&quot; said Dr.  
Pea- body. \&quot;Think of the moral earthquake and volcano that has burst in  
the midst of the land, in our own state, since last we met.  
  
\&quot;Who would have believed that a massacre that reminds one of St.  
Bartholomew\&#x27;s night and of the atroci- ties of the unspeakable Turk in  
Ar- menia, could occur among our own fellow-citizens in East St. Louis?  
  
\&quot;But, beware! The peril is nearer than that. The mutterings of the vol-  
cano are felt in Chicago. The single explosion is not the most  
significant\&#x27; thing. The race prejudice, contempt and hatred,  
working-working be- neath-these are the hell below-and they find some  
lodgment in all our hearts; God help us.  
  
\&quot;There is far more danger to the republic from race hatred within our  
borders than from all the Germans put together.  
  
\&quot;Christian citizens of Chicago, think this thing through. Try to make  
up your mind beforehand what you will do and say when the earthquake and  
the volcano shall be around you. Our country is in dire need of clear  
heads and stout hearts-Christian hearts, both within and without.\&quot;

**THE DRED SCOTT DECISION.**  
  
It was fifty years ago March 6, 1857, that the Supreme Court of the!  
United States rendered its decision in the famous Dred Scott case. The  
re- sults which followed this decision were stupendous and far-reaching.  
  
Dred Scott was a slave belonging to a surgeon in the United States army.  
He was taken by his master to Fort Snelling, in the State of Illinois,  
terri- tory from which, by the ordinance of 1787, slavery had been  
forever ex cluded. Afterward he was carried into Missouri, where he was  
hired as a slave. Claiming freedom on the ground that his residence in  
Illinois had wiped out his status as a slave, his case was taken before  
the Supreme Court for settlement.  
  
After a three years\&#x27; consideration of the case the decision of the  
court was pronounced in an exhaustive opinion delivered by Chief Justice  
Taney, seven of the nine judges concurring.  
  
In substance, the decision was as follows: (1) That persons of the  
African race were not, and could not be, acknowledged as \&quot;part of the  
peo- ple,\&quot; or citizens, under the Constitu- tion of the United States.  
(2) That Congress had no right to exclude citi- zens of the South from  
taking their Negro servants, as any other property, into any part of the  
community, and that they were entitled to claim its protection therein.  
(3) That the Mis- souri Compromise of 1820, in so far as It prohibited  
African slavery north of a designated line, was unconstitutional and  
void.  
  
The decision raised a storm from one end of the country to the other and  
made the civil war a foregone conclusion.

The Year Book of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in Amer-  
ica for 1917 states that 747,000 people \&quot;joined the church\&quot; during the  
year 1916. Judging by the evidences of Christianity as exemplified by  
the so- called Christians in the country, \&quot;joining the church\&quot; is  
largely a mat- ter of hypocrisy. The people of the United States are  
further from true Christianity than ever before in the history of the  
nation.  
  
Charles Edward Russell, a member of the American Co mission to Rus- sia,  
appeals to the American people to help Russia build a republic. Per-  
haps in the years to come when the Russian republic has been built, some  
great Russian will aid the establish- ment in America a republic which  
knows neither race, creed nor color.

Mr. William H. Steward, editor of the American Baptist, Louisville, Ky.,  
celebrated the seventieth anniversary of his birthday last Thursday.  
Brother Steward has been in the harness for many years as an editor and  
also as a church worker and is a living refuta- tion of the adage that  
\&quot;the good die young.\&quot;

The National Evangelistic Alliance of America has appealed to President  
Wilson that flags on public buildings be at half-mast on Sunday, July  
29th, in memory of persons who lost their lives in the East St. Louis

**THE ILLINOIS HORROR**  
  
Ashamed to Register From East St. Louis.  
  
(Chicago Daily American.)  
  
W. R. Neal is manager of a hotel in East St. Louis, Ill. Today when he  
registered at the Congress Hotel he gave his address as St. Louis, Mo.  
\&quot;I\&#x27;m ashamed to say I came from East St. Louis,\&quot; he told the clerk.

**Brought Disgrace on Lincoln\&#x27;s State.**  
  
(From the Chicago Daily News.)  
  
Mob frenzy displayed in some of its most dreadful forms in East St.  
Louis yesterday has brought disgrace and just reproach upon the state of  
Abra- ham Lincoln.  
  
------------------  
  
**The Most Disgraceful Outbreak.**  
  
(From the Chicago Journal.)  
  
The East St. Louis affair is the most disastrous and disgraceful  
outbreak the state has known for a generation; perhaps the worst it has  
ever known. That it should come during the heat of a foreign war and on  
the eve of Independence Day makes it still more ominous.  
  
------------------  
  
**The Law Itself on Trial.**  
  
(From the Chicago Herald.)  
  
East St. Louis, Ill., the law itself, are all on trial until this grim,  
terrible business is settled and settled rightly Failure of justice  
means a vicious precedent that will plague the com- monwealth for years  
to come. When the issue of law or anarchy is pre- sented as plainly as  
in the orgy at East St. Louis there should be but one answer.  
  
------------------  
  
**The Shame of Illinois.**  
  
(From the Chicago Tribune.)  
  
The riot at East St. Louis is one of the worst blots on the good name of  
an American community in our whole history. Illinois must bow her head  
in shame before this disgrace. We have no excuse. There can be no ex-  
cuse for such a break down of the most primitive safeguards of civil gov  
ernment, for such betrayal of the first duty of ordered society.  
  
------------------  
  
**Will Sue for Damages.**  
  
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, with  
former Judge Edward Osgood Brown of the appellate court president of the  
local chapter, is planning to institute suits under the Illinois  
statutes against the city of East St. Louis and St. Clair county for  
personal damages on be half of the dependents of the Negro men and women  
who died at the hands of the incensed mobs in the orgy of murder and  
arson several days ago.  
  
Under the statutes, the dependents have actions against both the city  
and the county for damages to property, life and limb, the judgments not  
to ex- ceed \$5,000 in each case. This may mean suits for nearly  
\$1,000,000 when the final loss of the scores killed, the hundreds  
injured and the many homes destroyed is recorded.  
  
------------------  
  
**The Illinois Massacre.**  
  
(From the Chicago Evening Post.)  
  
\&quot;In ouah town we don\&#x27;t let a nig gah get off the train long enough to  
brush youah coat, not even if he\&#x27;s a po\&#x27;tah on a Pullman.\&quot;  
  
They\&#x27;ll tell you this in just these accents in some of the southern  
towns of Illinois.  
  
And it was from these towns that the militiamen came to \&quot;maintain or-  
der in East St. Louis.\&quot;  
  
This is the whole story of the fall- ure of the militia in the worst  
race riet that has disgraced Illinois since Lovejoy was martyred.  
  
Troops from Northern Illinois should have been sent into East St. Louis:  
troops from Southern Illinois should not have been sent there. For the  
twi- light zone of the Mason and Dixon line cuts across the central and  
south- ern portions of the state.  
  
N. A. A. C. P.  
  
Anent the Horrible, Inhuman Mob Massacre at East St. Louis, and one of  
its Innocent, Young Victims  
  
When the first troubles in East St. Louis became public late in May, the  
N. A. A. C. P. recognized that this was something of the utmost import-  
ance. East St. Louis is one of the great centers whither the migration  
of at least a quarter million of colored people has set. It was  
therefore of the utmost importance to understand any troubles that might  
arise and to ward them off if possible. We recognized the strong  
interest that various people South and North had in stopping col- ored  
migration and discouraging the emancipation of the colored serf.  
  
Before, however, our representative could get to East St. Louis, the  
ter- rible riot of July 2 had taken place. A hundred or more colored  
people were killed, scores of homes and property destroyed, and six  
thousand refugees crossed the bridge into St. Louis. The St. Louis  
Branch of the N. A. A. C. P. immediately began relief work. Our members,  
prominent in professions and in business, for nearly ten days gave  
almost their entire time to the succor of the victims. A mass meet- ing  
was called and a special finance committee appointed. Contributions came  
from as far as Kansas City and Chicago and some \$400 and \$500 was  
immediately collected. The Association worked in conjunction with the  
white Red Cross and with other col- ored individuals in the city. The  
Municipal Lodging House was opened and hundreds of individuals\&#x27; homes.  
  
Immediate steps were taken to pre- pare legal cases against the city and  
county. The Legal Committee of the Association held open doors and hun-  
dreds of declarations of losses were received by Attorney Phillips. Dr.  
W. P. Curtis and others gave much time to the wounds of the victims.  
From the National Office, Dr. Du Bois was sent to make a thorough study  
of the situation, and Miss Martha Gruening to inquire into the attitude  
of the em- ployers and labor unions.  
  
Dr. Du Bois organized a force of twenty-five volunteer workers and five  
paid workers. Chancellor Lloyd of the Knights of Pythias kindly donated  
the rarlors of the Pythian Hall, and Dr. Curtis donated an office on  
Market street. Clerks were installed and the stories of nearly two  
hundred victims carefully taken down. Detailed sta tistics covering  
fifteen hundred of the refuges were also compiled. Visits were made to  
the various sections of East St. Louis and to the colored set- Elements  
of Brooklyn and National City. Several meetings of the execu tive  
committee of the Branch were held and one mass meeting of citi zens  
which overflowed the beautiful Presbyterian Church on Pine street. Every  
effort was made to co operate with churches and other organizations with  
notable success. We also got in touch with leading white citizens like  
Ex-Secretary Nagel and Mr. C. M. Hub- bard and Miss Pulliam of the Red  
Cross.  
  
The Chicago Branch contributed \$200 to the relief funds and also, under  
Judge Brown, is preparing to give legal laid to the prosecution of the  
county and eity. It will be remembered that Illinois has two statutes  
which bear upon this riot, first an \&quot;Act to indem- inify the owners of  
property for dam- ages caused by mobs and riots,\&quot; passed 1887. and the  
other, an \&quot;Act to sup press mob violence,\&quot; approved in 1905. The  
Association, through its National Office and through the Chicago and St.  
Louis branches, proposes to leave no stone unturned to bring to justice  
the guilty perpetrators of the East St. Louis outrage. The St. Louis  
branch is still active, the investiga- tions of the National Office are  
pro- ceeding, and the Washington branch is pushing the resolutions for  
inves tigation introduced by Congressmen Dyer and Dallinger and Senator  
Sher- man. All members and friends of the race are urged to write to  
their Con- gressmen demanding passage of these resolutions which are H.  
J. Res. 118, H. J. Res. 124, and S. Con. Res. 10.  
  
Detailed stories of the truth about East St. Louis will appear shortly  
in various magazines and in the CRISIS. Persons who are convinced by our  
ex- perience in East St. Louis and else where that a national fighting  
body of this sort is absolutely indispensable are urged to join the  
Association and to contribute to our Anti-Lynching and Anti-Mob-Violence  
Fund. A check for 2100 has been received from the Knights of Pythias of  
the Grand Juris- diction of Illinois and other contribu- tions have been  
sent by various or- ganizations and individuals. Litera- ture and  
information may be had by writing to James W. Johnson, Act- ing  
Secretary, Room 518, 70 Fifth avenue, New York.

THE DRED SCOTT DECISION.  
It was fifty years ago-^-March 6,

a surgeon in the United States army.  
He was taken by his master to E&#x27;ort  
Snelling, in the State of Illinois, terri­  
tory from which, by the ordinance of  
1787, slavery had been forever ex  
eluded. Afterward he was carried into

that his residence in Illinois had wiped  
out his status as a slave, his case was

Rev. James S. Russell of Lawrenceville, Va., Recently Appointed Suffragan,  
or Jim Crow Bishop, for Several of the Southern  
States, Has Declined the Honor  
that racial hatred within the United  
States is more dangerous than all Ger­  
mans outside this country.  
Dr. Peabody likened the East St  
Louis massacre to the &quot;atrocities of  
the unspeakable Turk in Armenia.&quot;  
&quot;The country&#x27;s perils are not all on  
the sea and&quot; beyond,&quot; said Dr. Pea­  
body. &quot;Think of the moral earthquake  
and volcano that has burst in the  
midst of the land, in our own state,  
since last we met.  
&quot;Who would have believed that a  
massacre that reminds one of St  
Bartholomew&#x27;s night and of the atroci  
ties of the unspeakable Turk in Ar­  
menia, could occur among our own  
fellow-citizens in East St. Louis?  
&quot;But, beware! The peril is nearer  
than that. The mutterings of the vol  
cano are felt in Chicago. The single  
explosion is not the most significant  
thing. The race prejudice, contempt  
and hatred, workingworking be­  
neaththese are the hell belowand

A LITANY OF ATLANTA.

brutal massacre of colored people at

men, women and children were mur­  
dered because of their color. Dr. W.  
E. Burghardt Du Bois wrote the story

which appeared in the New York In­

THE&quot; DRED SCOTT DECISION.  
It was fifty years agoMarch 6,  
1857,that the Supreme Court of the  
United States rendered its decision in  
the famous Dred Scott case. The re­  
sults which followed this decision were  
stupendous and far-reaching.  
Dred Scott was a slave belonging to  
a surgeon in the United States army.  
He-was taken by his master to Port  
Snelling, in the State of Illinois, terri­  
tory from which, by the ordinance of  
1787, slavery had been forever ex  
eluded. Afterward he was carried into  
Missouri, where he was hired as a  
slave. Claiming freedom on the ground  
that his residence in Illinois had wiped  
out his status as a slave, his case was  
taken before the Supreme Court for  
settlement.  
After a three years&#x27; consideration of  
the case the decision of the court was  
pronounced in an exhaustive opinion  
delivered by Chief Justice Taney, seven  
of the nine judges concurring.  
In substance, the decision was as  
follows: (1) That persons of the  
African race were not, and could not  
be, acknowledged as &quot;part of the peo-  
ple,&quot; or citizens, under the Constitu­  
tion of the United States^ (2) That  
Congress had no right to exclude citi­  
zens of the South from taking their  
Negro servants, as any other property,  
Into any part of the community, and  
that they were entitled to claim its  
protection therein. (3) That the Mis­  
souri Compromise of 1820, in so far as  
It prohibited African slavery north of  
a designated line, was unconstitutional  
and void.  
The decision raised a storm from  
one end of the country to the other  
and made the civil war a foregone  
conclusion.  
The Year Book of the Federal Coun­  
cil of the Churches of Christ in Amer­  
ica for 1917 states that 747,000 people  
&quot;joined the church&quot; during the year  
1916. Judging by the evidences of  
Christianity as exemplified by the so-i  
called Christians in the country,}  
&quot;joining the church&quot; is largely a mat­  
fer of hypocrisy. The people of the  
United States are further from true1  
Christianity than ever before in the&#x27;  
of the nation.  
Charles Edward Russell, a member  
of the American Co- mission to Rus­  
sia, appeals to the American people  
to help Russia build a republic. Per­  
haps in the years to come when the  
Russian republic has been #built,

THE ILLINOIS HORROR  
Ashamed to Register From East  
St. Louis.  
(Chicago Daily American.)  
W. R. Neal is manager of a hotel  
in East St. Louis, 111. Today when  
he registered at the Congress Hotel  
he gave his address as St. Louis, Mo.  
&quot;I&#x27;m ashamed to say I came from  
East St. Louis,&quot; he told the clerks  
Brought Disgrace on Lincoln&#x27;s State.  
(From the Chicago Daily News.)  
Mob frenzy displayed in some of its  
most dreadful forms in East St. Louis  
yesterday has brought disgrace and  
just reproach upon the state of Abra­  
ham Lincoln.  
The Most Disgraceful Outbreak.  
(From the Chicago Journal.)  
The East St. Louis affair is the most  
disastrous and disgraceful outbreak  
the state has known for a generation  
perhaps the worst it has ever known.  
That it should come during the heat  
of a foreign war and on the eve of  
Independence Day makes it still more  
ominous.  
The Law Itself on Trial.  
(From the Chicago Herald.)  
East St. Louis, 111., the law itself,  
are all on trial until this grim, terrible  
business is settled and settled rightly  
Failure of justice means a vicious  
precedent that-will plague the com­  
monwealth for years to come. When  
the issue of law or anarchy is pre­  
sented as plainly as in the orgy at  
East St. Louis there should be but  
one answer.  
The Shame of Illinois.  
(From the Chicago Tribune.)  
The riot at East St. Louis is one of  
the worst blots on the good name of  
an American community in our whole  
history. Illinois must bow her head  
in shame before this disgrace. We  
have no excuse. There can be no ex­  
cuse for such a break down of the  
most primitive safeguards of civil gov­  
ernment, for such betrayal of the first  
duty of ordered society.  
Will Sue for Damages.  
The National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People, with  
former Judge Edward Osgood Brown  
of the appellate court president of the  
local chapter, is planning to institute  
suits under the Illinois statutes against  
the city of East St. Louis and St. Clair  
county for personal damages on be­  
half of the dependents of the Negro  
men and women who died at the hands  
of the incensed mobs in the orgy of  
murder and arson several days ago.  
Under the statutes, the dependents  
have actions against both the city and  
the county for damages to property,  
life and limb, the judgments not to ex­  
ceed $5,000 in each case. This may  
mean suits for nearly $1,000,000 when  
the final loss of the scores killed, the  
hundreds injured and the many homes  
destroyed is recorded.  
The Illinois Massacre.  
(From the Chicago Evening Post.)  
&quot;In ouah town we don&#x27;t let a nig­  
gah get off the train long enough to  
brush youah coat, not even if he&#x27;s a  
po&#x27;tah on a Pullman.&quot;  
They&#x27;ll tell you this in just these  
accents in some of the southern towns  
of Illinois.  
And it was from these towns that  
the militiamen came to &quot;maintain or­  
der in East St. Louis.&quot;  
This is the whole story of the fail­  
ure of the militia in the worst race  
riet that has disgraced Illinois since  
Lovejoy was martyred.  
Troops from Northern Illinois should  
have been sent into East St. Louis  
troops from Southern Illinois should  
not have been sent there. For the twi­  
light zone of the Mason and Dixon  
line cuts across the central and south­  
ern portions of the state.  
When the first troubles in East St.  
Louis became public late in May, the  
N. A. A. C. P. recognized that this  
was something of the utmost import­  
ance. East St. Louis ir one of the  
great centers whither the migration  
of at least a quarter million of colored  
people has set. It was therefore of the  
utmost importance to understand any  
troubles that might arise and to ward  
them off if possible. We recognized  
the strong interest that various people  
South and North had in stopping col­  
ored migration and discouraging the  
emancipation of the colored serf.  
Before, however, our representative  
could get to East St. Louis, the ter­  
rible riot of July 2 had taken place.  
A hundred or more colored people were  
killed, scores of homes and property  
destroyed, and six thousand refugees  
crossed the bridge into St. Louis. The  
St. Louis Branch-of the N. A. A. C. P.  
immediately began relief work. Our  
members, prominent in professions  
and in business, for nearly ten days  
gave almost their entire time to the  
succor of the victims. A mass meet­  
ing was called and a special finance  
committee appointed. Contributions  
came from as far as Kansas City and  
Chicago and some $400 and $500 was  
immediately collected. The Associa­  
tion worked in conjunction with the  
white Red Cross and with other col­  
ored individuals in the city. The  
Municipal Lodging House was opened  
and hundreds of individuals&#x27; homes.  
Immediate steps were taken to pre­  
pare legal cases against the city and

be sweeter than the applause of the

groes&#x27; than was done by these white  
people. The organization of the man­  
hood of the nation for the protection  
of human life and liberty on the seas  
and for the deliverance of democracy  
in the world will be needed at home  
after its task abroad is done. While  
our fellowjcreatures in the United  
States are hunted and tortured as if  
they were wild beasts, government can  
scarcely be called democratic. So long  
as colored people are proscribed, dis­  
criminated? against, segregated and  
despised, ill-will and antipathy will  
furnish fertilizers of hatred and mur­  
der.  
WARNS AGAINST RACIAL HATRED.  
It is so unusual for a Christian  
minister to preach against racial hat­  
red that THE APPEAL is pleased to  
note that one minister has the cour­  
age of his convictions.  
In his sermon last Sunday, Rev. H.  
E. Peabody, pastor of the South Con­  
gregational Church, in Chicago, said  
that racial hatred within the United  
States is more dangerous than all Ger­  
mans outside this country.  
Dr. Peabody likened the East St  
Louis massacre to the &quot;atrocities of  
the unspeakable Turk in Armenia.&quot;  
&quot;The country&#x27;s perils are not all on  
the sea and beyond,&quot; said Dr. Pea­  
body. &quot;Think of the moral earthquake  
and volcano that has burst in the  
midst of the land, in our own state,  
since last we met.  
&quot;Who would have believed that a  
massacre that reminds one of St.  
Bartholomew&#x27;s night and of the atroci­  
ties of the unspeakable Turk in Ar­  
menia, could occur among our own  
fellow-citizens in East St. Louis?  
&quot;But, beware! The peril is nearer  
than that. The muttenngs of the vol­  
cano are felt in Chicago. The single  
explosion is not the most significant  
thing. The race prejudice, contempt  
and hatred, workingworking be­  
neaththese are the hell below?and  
they find some lodgment in all our  
hearts God help us.  
&quot;There is far more danger to the  
republic from race hatred within our  
borders than from all the Germans  
put together.  
&quot;Christian citizens of Chicago, think  
this thing through. Try to make up  
your mind beforehand what you will  
do and say when the earthquake and  
the voleano shall be around yQU. Our  
country is in dire need of clear heads  
and stout heartsChristian hearts,  
both within and without.&quot;  
A LITANY OF ATLANTA.  
In September, 1906, there was a  
brutal massacre of colored people at.  
Atlanta, Georgia. Scores ol colored  
men, women and children were mur­  
dered because of their color. Dr. W.  
E. Burghardt Du Bois wrote the story  
of the massacre in the form of a litany  
which appeared in the New York In­  
dependent shortly after its occur­  
rence. It was &quot;done in the day of  
death.&quot;  
The recent massacre at East St.  
Louis so resembles the Atlanta mur­  
derfest that we print in this issue Du  
Bois* &quot;A Litany of Atlanta,&quot; by ex­  
press permission of the New York In­  
dependent.  
The Year Book of the Federal Coun­  
cil of the Churches of Christ in Amer­  
ica for 1S17 states that 747,000 people  
&quot;joined the church&quot; during the year  
1916. Judging by the evidences of  
Christianity as exemplified by the^, so­  
called Christians in the country,  
&quot;joining the church&quot; is largely a mat­  
ter of hypocrisy. The people of the  
United States are further from true  
Christianity than ever before in the  
history of the nation.  
Charles Edward Russell, a member  
of the American Commission to Rus­  
sia, appeals to the American people  
to help Russia build a republic. Per­  
haps in the years to come when the  
Russian republic has been built, some  
great Russian will aid the establish­  
ment in America a republic which  
knows neither race, creed nor color.  
Mr. William H. Steward, editor of  
the American Baptist, Louisville, Ky.,  
celebrated the seventieth anniversary  
of his birthday last Thursday. Brother  
Steward has been in the harness for  
many years as an editor and also as  
a church worker and is a living refuta­  
tion of the adage that &quot;the good die  
young.&quot;  
According to statistics prepared  
by Frederick L. Hoffman for &quot;Spec­  
tator,&quot; Memphis, Tenn., has the un­  
enviable distinction of being the mur­  
der metropolis of the United States.  
More homicides were committed in  
Memphis than in any other city in  
proportion to the population.  
The National Evangelistic Alliance  
of America has appealed to President  
Wilson that flags on public buildings  
be at half-mast on Sunday, July 29th,  
in memory of persons who lost their  
lives in the East St. Louis riots

ST. LOUIS REFUGEES  
When the first troubles In East St.  
Louis became public late In May, the  
N. A. A. C. P. recognized that this was  
something ot the utmost Importance.  
East St. Louis Is one of the great cen­  
ters .whither the migration of at least  
a quarter of a million Negroes has set.  
It was therefore of the utmost Impor­  
tance to understand&quot; any troubles that  
might arise and to ward them off if  
possible. We recognized the strong in­  
terest that various people south and  
north had in stopping Negro migra­  
tion and discouraging the emancipa­  
tion of the black serf.  
Before, however, our representative  
could get to East St. Louis, the terri­  
ble riot of July 2 had taken place. A  
hundred or more Negroes were killed,  
scores of homes and property de­  
stroyed, and six thousand refugees  
crossed the bridge into St. Louis. Tho  
St. Louis Branch of the N. A. A. C. P.  
immediately began relief work. Our  
members, prominent in professions  
and in business, for nearly ten days  
gave almost their entire time to the  
succor of the victims. A mass meet­  
ing was called and a special finance  
committee appointed. Contributions  
came from as far as Kansas city ana  
Chicago and some 5400 or $500 was ;  
immedlatelv collected. The assocla-

Immediate steps were taken to pre­

Association held open doors and hun­  
dreds of declarations of losses were  
received by Attorney Phillips. Dr. W.

to the wounds ot the victims. From  
the National Office, Dr. Du Bols was  
sent to make a thorough study of the  
situation, and Miss Martha Gruenlng  
to Inquire Into the attitude of the em­  
ployers and labor unions.  
Dr. Du Bols organized a force of  
twenty-fivo volunteer workers and  
five paid workers. Chancellor Lloyd  
of the Knights of Pythias kindly do­  
nated the parlors of the Pythian Hall,  
and Dr. Curtis donated an office on  
&quot;Market street. Clerks were Installed  
and the stories of nearly two hundred  
-victims carefully taken down. De­  
tailed statistics covering fifteen hun­  
dred of the refugees were also com­  
plied. Visits were made to tho var­  
ious soctlons .of East St. Louis and to  
the colored settlements ot Brooklyn  
and National City. Several meetings  
of the executive committee of the  
Branch were held and one mass meet­

boautiful Presbyterian Church on Pine  
street. Every effort was made to co­  
operate with churches and other or­

When the first troubles In East St  
Louis became public late in May the  
National Association For the Advance­  
ment of Colored People recognized that  
this was something of the utmost im­  
portance. East St. Louis is one of the  
great centers whither the migration of  
at least a quarter of a million Negroes  
has set. It was therefore of great im­  
portance to understand any troubles  
that might arise and to ward them off  
if possible. The statement of the asso­

WARNS AGAINST RACIAL HATRED.  
It is so unusual for a Christian  
minister to preach against racial hat­  
red that THE APPEAL is pleased to  
note that one minister has the cour­  
age of his convictions.  
In nis sermon last Sunday, Rev. H.  
E. Peabody, pastor of the South Con­  
gregational Church, in Chicago, said  
that racial hatred within the United  
States *i more dangerous than all Ger­  
mans on*side this country.  
Dr. Peabody likened the East St  
Louis massacre to the &quot;atrocities of  
the unspeakable Turk in Armenia.&quot;  
&quot;The country&#x27;s perils are not all on  
the sea and beyond,&quot; said Dr. Pea­  
body. &quot;Think of the moral earthquake  
and volcano that has burst in the  
midst of the land, in our own state,  
since last we met.  
&quot;Who would have believed that a  
massacre that reminds one of St.  
Bartholomew&#x27;s night and of the atroci­  
ties of the unspeakable Turk in Ar­  
menia, could occur among our own  
fellow-citizens in East St. Louis?  
&quot;But, beware! The peril is nearer  
than that. The mutterlngs of the vol­  
cano are felt in Chicago. The. single  
explosion is not the most significant  
thing. The race prejudice, contempt  
and hatred, workingworking be­  
neaththese are the hell belowand  
they find some lodgment in all our  
hearts God help us.  
&quot;There is far more danger to the  
republic from race hatred within our  
borders than from all the Germans  
put together.  
&quot;Christian citizens of Chicago, think  
this thing through. Try to make up  
your mind beforehand what you will  
&amp;  
kROM  
do and say when the earthquake and  
the volcano shall be around you. Our  
country Is in dire need of clear heads  
and stout heartsChristian hearts,  
both within and without.&quot;  
A LITANY OF ATLANTA.  
In September, 1906, there was a  
brutal massacre of colored people at  
Atlanta, Georgia. Scores of colored  
men, women and children were mur­  
dered because of their color. Dr. W.  
E. Burghardt Du Bois wrote the story  
of the massacre In the form of a litany  
which appeared in the New York In­  
dependent shortly after its occur­  
rence. It was &quot;done in the day of  
death.&quot;  
The recent massacre at East St.  
Louis so resembles the Atlanta mur­  
derfest that we print in this issue Du  
Bois&#x27; &quot;A Litany of Atlanta,&quot; by ex­  
press permission of the New York In­

CRIME AGAINST CIVILIZATION.  
In the opinion of THE( APPEAL,  
the strongest article denouncing the  
East Saint Louis massacre was an  
editorial published in the Christian  
Register of Boston, Mass. The Regis­  
ter js the leading Unitarian paper pub­  
lished in the United States and per­  
haps that accounts for the article.  
The Unitarian church is one of the  
few Christian denominations in Amer­  
ica in which there is no color line.  
The orthodox Christian sects in Amer­  
ica are so filled with prejudice that  
the ruthless massacre of helpless men,  
women and children fails to bring out  
a protest.  
The article from the Christian Reg­  
ister, which follows, is not so long as  
some of the articles which have ap­  
peared in the daily papers, but it is  
evidently the most sincere which THE  
APPEAL has seen:  
The hideous outrage against law  
and humanity in East St. Louis, I11.K  
makes us turn again from the barbari­  
ties of war to the ferocities of peace,  
from crimes against civilization abroad  
to crimes against civilization at home.  
The testimony of eye witnesses shows  
that nothing is to be learned among  
white people of this city from the cru­  
elties and brutalities of foreign con­  
quest. No tribes of any name or time  
have ever outdone the white men and  
women who burned colored men,  
women and children the other day in  
this American city. Nothing more re­  
volting was ever charged against Ne­  
groes than was done by these white  
people. The organization of the man­  
hood of. the nation for the protection  
of human life and liberty on the seas  
and for the deliverance of democracy  
in the world will be needed at home  
after its task abroad is done. While  
our fellow-creatures in the United  
States are hunted and tortured as if  
they were wild beasts, government can  
scarcely be called democratic. So long  
as colored people are proscribed, dis­  
criminated against, segregated and  
despised, ill-will and antipathy will  
furnish fertilizers of hatred and mur­  
der.

WARNS AGAINST RACIAL HATRED.  
It is so unusual for a Christian  
minister to preach against racial hat-,  
red that THE APPEAL is pleased to  
note that one minister has the cour­  
age of his convictions.  
In his sermon last Sunday, Rev. H.  
E. Peahody, pastor of the South Con­  
gregational Church, in Chicago, said  
that racial hatred within the United  
States is more dangerous than all Ger­  
mans outside this country.  
Dr. Peabody likened the East St  
Louis massacre to the &quot;atrocities of  
the unspeakable Turk in Armenia.&quot;  
&quot;The country&#x27;s perils are not all on  
the sear and beyond,&quot; said Dr. Pea­  
body. &quot;Think of the moral earthquake  
and volcano that has burst in the  
midst of the land, in our own state,  
since last we met.  
&quot;Who would have believed that a  
massacre that reminds one of St.  
Bartholomew&#x27;s night and of the atroci­  
ties of the unspeakable Turk in Ar­  
menia, could occur among our own  
fellow-citizens in East St. Louis?  
&quot;But, beware! The peril is nearer  
than that. The mutterings of the vol­  
cano are felt in Chicago. The single  
explosion is not the most significant  
thing. The race prejudice, contempt  
and hatred, workingworking be­  
neaththese are the hell belowand  
they find some lodgment in all our  
hearts God help us.  
&quot;There is far more danger to the  
republic from race hatred within our  
borders than from all the Germans  
put together. i

P Sixty-three years ago?March 6,  
1*67?the supreme court of the United  
States rendered its decision in the  
famous Dred Scott case, and it is  
fairly within the bounds of truth to  
say that the opinion that day delivered  
qt&gt;y the honorable tribunal  
made the war between the States a  
foregone conclusion.  
Dred Scott was a slave, belonging  
to a surgeon in the United States  
army. He was taken by his ntaster  
to Fort Snelllng, in the State of Illinois,  
territory from which, by the ordinance  
of 1787, slavery had been  
forever excluded. Afterward he was  
carried into Missouri, where he was  
hired as a slave. Claiming freedom  
on the ground that his residence in  
Illinois had wiped out his status as  
a slave, his qase was taken before the  
supreme court for settlement.  
After a three years&#x27; consideration  
of the case the decision of the court  
was pronounced in an exhaustive  
opinion delivered by Chief Justice  
Taney, seven of the nine judges con­  
  
curnnr.  
In substance, the decision was rn  
follows: (1) That persons of the  
(African race were not, and could not  
be, acknowledged as &quot;part of the  
people,&quot; or cltisens, under the constitution  
of the United States; (2) that  
Congress had no right to exclude  
cltisens of the South from taking  
negro servants, as any other property.  
into any part of the common territory,  
and that they were entitled to  
claim Its protection therein; (3)  
that the Missouri compromise of  
1820, In so far as it prohibited African  
slavery north of a designated
