*FIEND LYNCHED**  
  
**The Brutal Assault on a Young Girl at Honea Path Avenged.**  
  
**BRUTE HUNG AND SHOT**  
  
**Taken From Officers After Exciting Chase Through Several Counties, the  
Fiend was Taken to the Scene of His Crime, Hung and Riddled With  
Bullets.**  
  
A negro boy, about seventeen years old, committed a criminal assault on  
a twelve year old white girl at Honea Path on Tuesday morning. The  
brutal assault occurred about half-past seven o\&#x27;clock some three  
hundred yards from the limits of town, where the little girl had gone to  
put a cow in a pasture.  
  
According to the little girl, she was attacked from the rear, while she  
was going to a pasture with cows, the attack being made within three  
hundred yards of the incorporated limits of Honea Path, and dragging his  
little victim about seventy-five yards into a patch of woods he  
accomplished his dastardly purpose behind a dead log. The little girl  
emerged from the woods, attracted the attention of a passerby and gave  
the alarm.  
  
The negro then passed through the town to a butcher shop where he  
worked. He was found later at the shop by Constable Haynes, who took him  
before the girl, and after she had positively identified him, the  
constable, with two other citizens, hurried the negro to the jail at  
Anderson in an automobile. the infuriated citizens were searching the  
woods during the while and did not learn that the negro had been  
apprehended until he was on his way to the jail.  
  
As soon as the dastardly outrage became known the people of Honea Path  
gathered and began a rigid search as above stated for the fiend. As soon  
as it was learned that the negro had been caught and taken to Anderson,  
a crowd left Honea Path for that place, bent on lynching the fiend if  
trey could get him in their hands.  
  
A dispatch from Anderson says more than a hundred heavily armed men  
arrived there at eleven o\&#x27;clock from Honea Path. Some came on trolley  
cars, others on the train, and the remainder in automobiles. Fifteen  
minutes before the crowd arrived at Anderson the negrohad been taken in  
a fast automobile and was speeding to the Greenville jail, thirty six  
miles away.  
  
The Honea Path citizens followed in pursuit. They left Anderson in about  
ten automobiles. The men with the prisoner arrived in Greenville at ten  
minutes to two o\&#x27;clock. The car they left in was a fast one, but when  
it departed from Anderson it had no chains on the wheels. It had been  
raining all night and the roads were muddy, heavy and slippery.  
  
At 1:50 o\&#x27;clock the Anderson automobile dashed through the streets of  
Greenville and up to the county jail door. At the jail the sheriff had  
received a telephone message from Sheriff King, at Anderson to spirit  
the negro off to Spartanburg. A change of automobiles was made at the  
jail and the flight to Spartanburg taken up.  
  
Within ten minutes after the automobile bearing the negro had departed,  
a big Anderson touring car, containing Josh Ashley and four other men,  
steamed through Main street. \&quot;Citizen\&quot; Josh clutched a Winchester  
rifle in his hands and eagerly inquired where the negro had been taken.  
Upon being told that the party had proceeded to Spartanburg, the word of  
command was given and the big auto dashed on up the street.  
  
Within five minutes another Anderson car steamed into the city, closely  
followed by still another machine. The mud-bespattered occupants, upon  
being readily informed by Greenville citizens which way the negro had  
carried, applied the power to their machines and dashed on. At  
Greenville the pursuers divided, some going one road and some another.  
  
In the depths of a forest six miles north of Greenville, an armed mob of  
twenty-five men, headed by \&quot;Citizen\&quot; Josh Ashley, of Honea Path, a  
member of Anderson County\&#x27;s legislative delegation overpowered Deputy  
Sheriff Van B. Martin, of Anderson County and Sheriff J. Perry Poole, of  
Greenville County, and took the fiend from their custody.  
  
The trembling negro was placed in the car in which Ashley and four other  
men rode and followed by a train of several automobiles from Anderson  
and Greenville counties, loaded with determined men and bristling with  
shotguns and rifles, the ringleaders turned in their fury and started  
toward Honea Path. Promises were made the sheriffs that the negro would  
be carried back to the scene of his crime and the \&quot;older heads\&quot; of the  
town consulted as to what should be done with him.  
  
The negro was carried to the identical spot where the crime was  
committed and from there was taken to the nearest telephone pole and  
swung up by one foot. Four hundred shots, as near as can be estimated  
were fired into his body. Winchester rifles, magazine pistols, revolvers  
and shotguns being the weapons of death used. Thus ended one of the most  
sensational man chases that section of the State has ever known.  
  
Three negro men were carried before the little girl who lived with her  
stepmother. She identified the last one, Willis Jackson, as the fiend  
who had attacked her.She said she was sure that neither of the first two  
was the brute, but she readily recognized the third one, and the  
universal opinion is that the negro who committed the outrage was the  
one hung and shot to death at Honea Path Tuesday night, several hours  
after the commission of the awful crime.  
  
The little girl is in a critical condition. She was badly bruised,  
terribly lacerated and was greatly shocked. She displayed an unusual  
amount of nerve, however, in looking at the three negroes brought before  
her for identification. The father of the lass is engaged in the lumber  
business in Southwest Georgia, and was away from home at the time. The  
mother of the little girl is dead, having been accidentally shot by her  
husband some years ago.

Sheriff Poole received word from the  
Anderson sheriff that he had sent a  
niegro to Greenville for safe keeping  
and sked that the prisoner be con­  
fined in the county Ja!i. Sheriff Poole  
secured an automobile at once and  
went to meet, the parties, bringing the  
aiegro to Greenville. Shortly after he  
left, a telephone call to his office, from  
Piedmont, stated that the automobile

King, at Anderson, to spirit the negro

ing readily informed by Greenville cit­  
izens which way the negro had been  
carried, applied the power to their ma­  
chines and dashed on.

IEND LYNCHED  
&#x27;he Brutal Assault on a Young White  
Girl at Bonea Path Avenged.  
BRUTE HUNG AND. SHOT  
raken from Officers After Exciting  
Chase Through Several Counties,  
the Fiend was Taken to the Scene  
of His Crime, Hung and Riddled  
With Bullets.  
A negro boy, about seventeen  
rears old, committed a criminal as­  
ault on a twelve year old white  
irl at Honea Path on Tuesday  
norning. The brutal assault occur­  
7ed about half-past seven o&#x27;clock  
some three hundred yards from the  
Limits of the town, where the little  
irl had gone to put a cow in a  
pasture.  
According to the little girl, she  
was attacked from the rear ,while she  
wvas going to a pasture with cows, the  
attack being made within three hun­  
cred yards of the incorporated lim­  
its of Honea Path, and after drag­  
ing his little victim about seventy­  
five yards into a patch of woods he  
ccomplished his dasstardly purpose  
behind a dead log. The little girl  
emerged from the woods, attracted  
the attention of a passerby and gave  
the alarm.  
The neg7ro then passed through the  
town to a butcher shop where he  
worked. He was found later a.t the  
shop by Constable Haynes, who tool,  
him before the girl, and after she  
had positively ident-ified him, the  
constable, with two other citizens  
hurried the negro to the jail at An  
derson in an automobile. The infur  
iated citizens were searching the  
woods during the while and did no  
[6arn tha.t the negro had been ap  
prehended until he was on his wai  
to the jail.  
As soon as the dastardly outragi  
became known the people of Hone,  
Path gathered and began a rigi&lt;  
search as above stated for the fiend  
As soon as it was learned that th  
negro had been caught and taken t  
Anderson, a crowd left Honea Pat  
for that place, bent on lynching th  
fiend if trey could get him in thei  
hands.  
A dispatch from Anderson say  
more than a hundred heavily armei  
men arrived there at eleven o&#x27;cloc1  
from Honea Path. Some came oi  
trolley cars, others on the train, ani  
the remainder in automobiles. Fif  
teen minutes before the crowd ar  
rived at Anderson thenegro had bee:  
taken in a fast automobile and wa  
speeding to the Greenville jail, thirt  
six miles away.  
The Honea Path citizens followe  
in pursuit. They left Anderson i  
about ten automobiles The me  
with the prisoner arrived in Greet  
ville at ten minutes to two o&#x27;clocl  
The car they left mn was a fast oni  
but when it departed from Anderso:  
it had no chains on the wheels.]  
had been raining all night and th  
roads were muddy, heavy and slij  
pery.

At 1.50 o&#x27;clock the Anderson at  
tomobile dashed through the street  
of Greenville and up to the count  
jail door. At the jail the sheriff &#x27;ha  
received a telephone message froi  
3heriff King, at Anderson to spiri  
the negro off to Spartanburg.  
change of automobiles was made a  
the jail and the flight to Spartanbur  
taken up.  
Within ten minutes after the a.utc  
mobile .bearing the negro &#x27;had depari  
sd, a big Aaderson touring car, cot  
taining Josh Ashley and four othe  
nen, steamed through Matn streel  
&quot;Citizen&quot; Josh clutched a Winch~e!  
er rifle in his hands and eagerly it  
quired where the negro had bee:  
taken. Upon being told that the par  
y had proceeded to Spartanbu-g, tb  
word of command was given and th  
big auto dashed on up the street.  
Within five minutes another Ar  
derson car steamed into the city  
closely followed by still another ma  
chine. The mud-bespattered occu  
pants, upon being readily informe  
by Greenville citizels which !va:  
the negro had been carried, appliel  
the power to their machines a.n  
dashed on. At Greenville the pur  
suers divided, some going one roa  
and some another.  
In the depths of a forest six mile  
north of Greenville, an armed mo  
of twenty-five men, headeAd by &quot;Cit  
izen &#x27; John Ashley, of Honea Path,  
member of Anderson County&#x27;s legis  
ative delegation overpowered Dep  
uty Sheriff Van iB. Martin, of Ander  
son County, and Sheriff J. Perr:  
Poole, of Greenville County, and too:  
the fiend from their custody.  
The trem.bling negro was placed i2  
the car in which Ashley and fou:  
other men rode and followed by  
train of several automobiles fron  
Anderson and Gileenville counti es  
oaded with determined men an&lt;  
bristling with shotguns and rifles, th&lt;  
ingleaders turned in their fury anE  
started toward Honea Path. Prom  
ises were made the sheriffs that the  
tegro would be carried bacek to th&lt;  
scene of his crime and the &quot;olde:  
heads&quot; of the town consulted as tE  
what should be done with him.  
The negro was carried to the iden  
tical spot where the crime was com  
mitted and from there was taken tc  
the nearest telephone pole and swunl  
up by one foot. Four hundred shots  
as near as can be estimated were  
fired into his body. Winchester ri  
ties, magazine pistols, revolvers and  
shotguns being the weapons of death  
used. Thus ended one of the most  
sensational man chases that section  
of the State has ever known.  
Three negro men were carried be­  
fore tre little girl who lived with  
her stepmother. She identified the  
last one, Willis Jackson, as the fiend  
who had attacked her. She said she  
was sure that neither of the first  
two was the brute, but she readily  
-ecognized the third one, and the  
universal opinion is that the negro  
wvho committted the outrage was the  
yne hung and shot to death at Honea  
Path Tuesday night, several hours  
after the commission of the awful  
:rime.  
The little girl is in a critical con­
