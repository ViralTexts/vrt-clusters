**A LITANY OF ATLANTA.**  
  
In September, 1906, there was a brutal massacre of colored people at  
Atlanta, Georgia. Scores of colored men, women and children were mur-  
dered because of their color. Dr. W. E. Burghardt Du Bois wrote the  
story of the massacre in the form of a litany which appeared in the New  
York In- dependent shortly after its Occur- rence. It was \&quot;done in the  
day of death.\&quot;  
  
The recent massacre at East St. Louis so resembles the Atlanta mur-  
iderfest that we print in this issue Du Bois\&#x27; \&quot;A Litany of Atlanta,\&quot;  
by ex- press permission of the New York In- dependent.

 from the barbari ties of war to the ferocities of  
peace from crimes against civilization abroad to crimes against  
civilization at home The testimony of eye witnesses shows that nothing  
is to be learned among white people of this city from the cru- elties  
and brutalities of foreign con- quest. No tribes of any name or time  
have ever outdone the white men and women who burned colored men, women  
and children the other day in this American eity. Nothing more re-  
volting was ever charged against Ne- groes than was done by these white  
people. The organization of the ma

 of  
the unspeakable Turk in Armenia.\&quot;  
  
\&quot;The country\&#x27;s perils are not all on the sea and beyond,\&quot; said Dr.  
Pea- body. \&quot;Think of the moral earthquake and volcano that has burst in  
the midst of the land, in our own state, since last we met.  
  
\&quot;Who would have believed that a massacre that reminds one of St.  
Bartholomew\&#x27;s night and of the atroci- ties of the unspeakable Turk in  
Ar- menia, could occur among our own fellow-citizens in East St. Louis?  
  
\&quot;But, beware! The peril is nearer than that. The mutterings of the vol-  
cano are felt in Chicago. The single explosion is not the most  
significant thing. The race prejudice, contempt and hatred,  
working-working be neath-these are the hell below-and they find some  
lodgment in all our hearts; God help us.  
  
\&quot;There is far more danger to the republic from race hatred within our  
borders than from all the Germans put together.  
  
\&quot;Christian citizens of Chicago, think this thing through. Try to make  
up your mind beforehand what you will do and say when the earthquake and  
  
the volcano shall be around you. Our country is in dire need of clear  
heads and stout hearts-Christian hearts, both within and without.\&quot;

**PATRIOTIC MID-YEAR EDITION.**  
  
This issue is the Patriotic Mid-Year Edition of THE APPEAL.  
  
THE APPEAL is an American news- paper without any hyphen, prefix or  
suffix.  
  
The editor of THE APPEAL is an American without any hyphen, prefix or  
suffix.  
  
THE APPEAL believes that every person born in the United States is an  
American, should feel that he is an American and should be ready to  
sacri- fice all of his possessions and even his life to defend the  
United States.  
  
In return for his loyalty to his na- tive land, THE APPEAL believes that  
every American has the right to ex- pect every right and privilege ac-  
corded to every other American, No, land is a democracy in which there  
are two classes of citizens.  
  
These are the days that we should feel patriotic. One hundred and forty-  
one years ago the United States shook off the bonds of Great Britain and  
be- came independent.  
  
The Declaration of Independence states that \&quot;all men are created equal  
and endowed by their creator with cer- tain inalienable rights among  
which are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. After one hundred  
and forty-one years this ideal has not been realized and our much  
vaunted de- mocracy is largely a sham, but some progress has been made.  
  
We are now at war and it is claimed that we are fighting for world-wide  
democracy, and in spite of the fact that many forces have been at work  
in recent years to retard the growth of democracy, THE APPEAL believes  
that the end of the war will find the United States further advanced in  
true democracy than may appear possible at the present time, and in  
spite of it self.  
  
Not only the United States but in the whole world we are about to enter  
an era in which the basic principle will be human brotherhood.

The Year Book of the Federal Coun- cil of the Churches of Christ in Amer  
ica for 1917 states that 747,000 people \&quot;joined the church\&quot; during the  
year 1916. Judging by the evidences of Christianity as exemplified by  
the so- called Christians in the country, \&quot;joining the church\&quot; is  
largely a mat- ter of hypocrisy. The people of the United States are  
further from true Christianity than ever before in the history of the  
nation.

Charles Edward Russell, a member of the American Commission to Rus- sia,  
appeals to the American people to help Russia build a republic. Per-  
haps in the years to come when the Russian republic has been built, some  
great Russian will aid the establish- ment in America a republic which  
knows neither race, creed nor color.

The National Evangelistic Alliance of America has appealed to President  
Wilson that flags on public buildings be at half-mast on Sunday, July  
29th, in memory of persons who lost their lives in the East St. Louis  
riots.

**The Shame of Illinois.**  
  
(From the Chicago Tribune.)  
  
The riot at East St. Louis is one of the worst blots on the good name of  
an American community in our whole history. Illinois must bow her head  
in shame before this disgrace. We have no excus

pter, is planning to institute suits under the Illinois  
statutes against the city of East St. Louis and St. Clair county for  
personal damages on be- half of the dependents of the Negro men and  
women who died at the hands of the incensed mobs in the orgy of murder  
and arson several days ago.  
  
Under the statutes, the dependents have actions against both the city  
and the county for damages to property, life and limb, the judgments not  
to ex- ceed \$5,000 in each case. This may mean suits for nearly  
\$1,000,000 when the final loss of the scores killed, the hundreds  
injured and the many homes destroyed is recorded.

| ears an-hungered in these fearful days-                               |  
|                                                                       |

| Listen to us, Thy children: our faces dark with doubt, are made a     |  
| mockery in Thy sanctuary. With uplifted hands we front Thy heaven, O  |  
| God, crying:                                                          |  
|                                                                       |

| We are not better than our fellows, Lord, we are but weak and human   |  
| men. When our devils do deviltry, curse Thou the doer and the deed:   |  
| curse them as we curse them, do to them all and more than ever they   |  
| have done to innocerce and weakness, to womanhood and home.           |  
|                                                                       |

| And yet whose is the deeper guilt? Who made these devils? Who nursed  |  
| them in crime and fed them on injustice? Who ravished and debauched   |  
| their mothers and their grandmothers? Who bought and sold their       |  
| crime, and waxed fat and rich on public iniquity?                     |  
|                                                                       |

|                                                                       |  
| Is this Thy justice, O Father, that guile be easier than innocence,   |  
| and the innocent crucified for the guilt of the untouched guilty?     |  
|                                                                       |

| Wherefore do we pray? Is not the God of the fathers dead? Have not    |  
| seers seen in Heaven\&#x27;s halls Thine hearsed and lifeless form stark   |  
| amidst the black and rolling smoke of sin, where all along bow bitter |  
| forms of endless dead?                                                |

| Thou art not dead, but flown afar, up hills of endless light, thru    |  
| blazing corridors of suns, where worlds do swing of good and gentle   |  
| men, of women strong and free-far from the cozenage, black hypocrisy  |  
| and chaste prostitution of this shameful speck of dust!               |

| A city lay in travail, God our Lord, and from her loins sprang twin   |  
| Murder and Black Hate. Red was the midnight; clang, crack\&quot; and cry   |  
| of death and fury filled the air and trembled underneath the stars    |  
| when church spires pointed silently to Thee. And all this was to sate |  
| the greed of greedy men who hide behind the veil of vengeance!        |

| In the pale, still morning we looked upon the deed. We stopped our    |  
| ears and held our leaping hands, but they-did they not wag their      |  
| heads and leer and cry with bloody jaws: Cease from Crime! The word   |  
| was mockery, for thus they train a hundred crimes while we do cure    |

| They told him: Work and Rise. He worked. Did this man sin?. Nay, but  |

rn into the  
souls of your children so that they  
may know that in its efforts to de  
grade the Colored race and reauce it  
to a condition not far removed from  
slavery, the South does not hesitate  
to murder innocent men, women and  
children.  
BLOOD LUST OF THE MOB.  
Just recently a Negro was lynched  
by a mob at Greenville, Georgia. The  
very next day it was announced that  
the Negro&#x27;s innocence had been com­  
pletely proved/the real culprit having  
been apprehended and confessed.  
The mob that destroyed an innocent  
man will go its way undisturbed,  
yet it committed hot-blooded murder  
without justification.  
Silent God, Thou whose voice afar in mist and mystery hath  
left our ears an-hungered in these fearful days  
Hear us, good Lord I  
J- L&#x27;sten to us, Thy children: cur faces dark with doubt, are made  
a mockery in Thy sanctuary. With uplifted hands we front Thy  
heaven, O God, crying  
We Beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord I  
J* J* We are not better than our fellows, Lord, we are but weak and  
human men. When our devils do deviltry, cutse Thou the doer and  
the deed: curse them as we curse them, do to them all and more  
than ever they have done to innccer.ce and weakness, to womanhood  
and home.  
Have mercy upon us, miserable sinners I  
a* And yet whose is the deeper guilt? Who made these devils?  
Who nursed them in crime and fed them On injustice? Who ravished  
and debauched their mothers and their grandmothers? Who bought  
and sold their crime, and waxed fat and rich on public iniquity?  
Thou knowest, good God I  
Is this Thy justice, O Father, that guile be easier thaninnocence,  
and the innocent crucified for the guilt of the untouched guilty?  
Justice, 0 Judge of men I  
J* Wherefore do we pray? Is not the God of the fathers dead?  
Have not seers seen in Heaven&#x27;s halls Thine hearsed and lifeless form  
stark amidst the black and rolling smoke of sin, where all along bow

&quot;Any prejudice whatever will  
be Insurmountable if those who

truckle to It and flatter it and

John Stuart Mill.  
THE ILLINOIS HORROR.  
The whole civilized world has heard  
of the Bast St. Louis horror and the  
daily papers have given graphic ac-  
counts of the same so we will make  
no attempt to give details here Words  
would fail us should we attempt to tell  
our sentiments on the subject, but  
elsewhere we have a number of ex-  
cerpts from contemporaries that tell  
how they feel about the matter. Read  
them.  
PATRIOTIC MID-YEAR EDITION.  
This issue is the Patriotic Mid-Year  
Edition of THE APPEAL.  
THE APPEAL is an American news­  
paper without any hyphen, prefix or  
suffix.  
The editor of THE APPEAL is an  
American without any hyphen, prefix  
or suffix  
THE APPEAL believes that every  
person born in the United States is an  
American, should feel that he is an  
American and should be ready to sacri­  
fice all of his possessions and even  
his life to defend the United States.  
In return for his loyalty to his na­  
tive land, THE APPEAL believes that  
every American has the right to ex­  
pect every right and &quot;privilege ac­  
corded to every other American No  
land is a democracy in which there  
are two classes of citizens.  
These are the days that we should  
feel patriotic One hundred and forty­  
one years ago the United States shook  
off the bonds of Great Britain and be­  
came independent.  
The Declaration of Independence  
states that &quot;all men are created equal  
and endowed by their creator with cer­  
tain inalienable rights among which  
are life, liberty and the pursuit of  
happiness. After one hundred and  
forty-one years this ideal has not been  
realized&quot; and our much vaunted de­  
mocracy is largely a sham, but some  
progress has been made.  
We are now at war and it is claimed  
that we are fighting for world-wide  
democracy, and in spite of the fact  
that many forces have been at work  
in recent years to retard the growth  
of democracy, THE APPEAL believes  
that the end of the war will find the i  
United States further advanced in true I  
democracy than may appear possible

PATRIOTIC MID-YEAR EDITION.  
This issue is the Patriotic Mid-Year  
Edition of THE APPEAL.  
Tim APPEAL is an American news­  
paper without any hyphen, prefix or  
suffix  
The editor of THE APPEAL is an  
American without any hyphen,  
prefix*Brought  
or suffix.  
^J/ i %^&#x27;.Hj,  
THE APPEAL believes that every  
person born in the United States is an  
American, should feel-that he is  
anjust  
American and should be ready to sacri­  
fice all of his possessions and even  
his life to defend the United States.  
In return for his loyalty to his na­  
tive land, THE APPEAL believes that  
every American has the right to ex­  
pect every right and privilege ac­  
corded to every other American. No  
land is a democracy in which there  
are two classes of citizens.  
These are the days that we should  
feel patriotic. One hundred and forty­  
one years ago the United States shook  
offthe bonds of Great Britain and be­  
came independent.  
The Declaration of Independence  
i states that^all men are created equal  
and endowed tfi| their creator with cer­  
tain inalienable rights among which  
are life, liberty and the pursuit of  
happiness. After one hundred and  
forty-one years this ideal has not been  
realized and our much vaunted de­  
mocracy is largely a sham, but some  
progress has been made.  
We are now at war and it is claimed  
that we are fighting for world-wide  
democracy, and in spite of the fact  
that many forces have been at work  
in recent years to retard the growth  
of democracy, THE APPEAL believes  
that the end of the war willfindthe  
United States further advanced in true  
democracy than may appear possible  
at the present time, and in spite of it­  
self.  
Not only the United States but inAdvancement  
the whole world we are about to enter  
an era in which the basic principle  
will be human brotherhood.  
The Year Book of the Federal Coun­  
cil of the Churches of Christ in Amer­  
ica for 1917 states that 747,000 people  
&quot;joined the church&quot; during the year  
Judging by the evidences of  
Christianity as exemplified by the so-the  
called Christians in the country,  
&quot;joining the church&quot; is largely a mat­  
te of hypocrisy. The people of the  
United States are further from true  
Christianity than ever before in the  
history of the nation.  
Charles Edward Russell, a member  
of the American Commission to Rus­  
sia, appeals to the American people  
to help Russia build a republic. Per­  
haps in the years to come when the  
Russian republic has been built, some  
great Russian will aid the establish­  
ment in America a republic which  
knows neither race, creed nor color.  
The National Evangelistic Alliance  
of America has appealed to President  
Wilson that flags on public buildings  
be at half-mast on Sunday, July 29th,  
te Wejnor-y Q$ persons who lost their  
lives in the East St. Louis riots.

Amen! Welcome dark sleep!

stars when church spires pointed silently to Thee. And all this was to  
sate the greed of greedy men who hide behind the veil of vengeance!  
Bend us Thine ear, 0 Lord I  
J J* In the pale, still morning we looked upon the 6tt6, We stopped  
our ears and held our leaping hands, but theydid they not wag their  
heads and leer and cry with bloody jaws: Cease from Crime I The word  
was mockery, for thus they train a hundred crimes while we docure one.

down  
the unspeakable Turk in Armenia  
&quot;The country&#x27;s perils are not all on  
the sea and beyond,&quot; said Dr. Pea­  
body. &quot;Think of the moral earthquake  
and volcano that has burst in the  
midst of the land, in our own state,  
since last we met.  
&quot;Who would have believed that a  
massacre that reminds one of St.demand  
Bartholomew&#x27;s night and of the atroci­  
ties of the unspeakable Turk in Ar­  
menia, could occur among our  
ownTAINS  
fellow-citizens in East St. Louis?  
&quot;But, beware! The peril is nearer  
than that. The mutterings of the vol­  
cano are felt in Chicago. The single  
explosion is not the most significant  
thing. The race prejudice, contempt  
and hatred, workingworking be­  
neaththese are the hell belowand  
they find some lodgment in all our  
hearts God help us.  
&quot;There is far more danger to the  
republic from race hatred within our  
borders than from all the Germans  
put together.  
&quot;Christian citizens of Chicago, think  
this thing through. Try to make up  
your mind beforehand what you will  
do and say when the earthquake and  
the volcano shall be around you. Our  
country is in dire need of clear heads  
and stout heartsChristian hearts,  
both within and without.
