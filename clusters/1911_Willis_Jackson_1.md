 from Honea Path this afternoon said that all is now quiet there, no more disorder of any kind is expected.  
  
Driver is Run Down.  
The Greenville News had the following this morning:   
At [?]:30 o’clock the Anderson automobile dashed through the streets of Greenville and up to the county jail door. At the jail, Sheriff Poole received a telephone message from Sheriff King at Anderson to spirit the negro on to Spartanburg. A change of automobiles was made at the jail and the flight to Spartanburg taken up. Within ten minutes, after the automobile bearing the negro had departed a big Andeson touting car, obtaining Josh Ashley and four other men steamed through Main street. “Citizen” Josh clutching a Winchester rifle in his hand and eagerly inquired where the negro had been taken. Upon being told that the party had proceeded to Spartanburg, the world of command was given and the big auto dashed onto the street. Within five minutes, another Anderson car steamed into the city, closely followed by another machine. The mud bespattered on [?], upon being readily informed by Greenville citizens which was the negro had been carried, applied the power to their machines and dashed on. At Greenville the mob divided, some taking one road to Spartanburg and some another. Others took to the Laurens road, thinking perhaps that the officers would spirit the negro to Fountain Inn, or some station on the C &amp; W C. railway and place him aboard a train for Columbia.  
Within an hour after the negro had been hurried through Greenville and the lad who drove the machine reappeared in the city, together with members of the local police force who had accompanied the Anderson deputies when they left for Spartanburg. This led many to believe that the negro had been taken from the car when a few miles out of Greenville and concealed in the woods. Within a few minutes after the lad reappeared. In Greenville, the car bearing Josh Ashley and his party rolled in sight. The pursuers had failed to overtake the party with the negro and were evidently on their way back to Anderson. Upon learning of the lad who drove the automobile being in the city, Citizen Josh Ashley instituted a search for him. The lad was chased into the rear of a drug store, where, despite the efforts of the police to protect him, Ashley and this crowd laid hands upon him. The lad was placed in Ashley’s machine and carried back toward Spartanburg.

The Story From Honea Path.  
Honea Path, Oct. 11: Stiff and Stark, riddled with shots, the lifeless body of Willis Jackson is hanging to a telephone post near the scene of the crime yesterday morning. The crowd of angry men has had its way. The tide of passion which swept all reason, before it has passed, and this morning beyond the interest of the curious the town has assumed its wonted quiet.  
Willis Jackson was arrested at first on suspicion, and because he met with the description which the outraged girl gave of her assailant. When he was taken before her she positively and without hesitation identified him.

committed here. The eleven year old child of one of our citizens was the victim of a criminal assault at the hands of a sixteen or seventeen year old boy. She had gone to carry this boy to the pasture, a quarter of a mile from home about 7.30 o’clock. She was on one of the main roads leading out of town and was seized and dragged into the woods about fifty yards where the attack was made, and it is feared that he accomplished his devilish purpose in the woods. In the woods there is every evidence of a fearful struggle. When the child was seized her assailant threatened to kill her if she cried out to give alarm. Terrified with fright she desisted from her cries. It is thought that the noise of a buggy approaching along the road may have frightened him and that he let his victim go. A gentleman from the country saw the negro come from the woods and seeing the child muddy and crying approached her. The news quickly spread. Willis Jackson was arrested on suspicion and taken before his victim, who positively identified him and as positively said that two other suspects were not the guilty party.

left, a telephone call to his office, from  
Piedmont, stated that the automobile  
containing the negro had just passed  
there and that some ten machines,  
containing the mob, were in close pur­  
suit and not more than ten minutes  
behind.  
Mob Close Behind at Greenville.  
At 1.50 o&#x27;clock the Anderson auto­  
mobile dashed through the streets of  
Greenville and up to the county jail  
door. At the jail Sheriff Poole receiv­  
ed a telephone message from Sheriff  
King, at Anderson, to spirit the negro  
on to Spartanburg. A change of au­  
tomobiles was made at the jail and  
the flight to Spartanburg taken up.  
Wlithin ten niinutes after the auto­  
mobiles bearing the negro had de­  
parted, a big Anderson touring car,  
containing Josh Ashley and four other  
men, steamed through Main street  
&quot;Citizen&quot; Josh clutched a Winchester  
rifie in his hands and eagerly inquir­  
ed where the negro had been taken.  
Upon being told that the party had  
proceeded to Spartanburg, the word  
of command was given and the big  
auto dashed on up the street.  
Within five minutes another Ander­  
son car steamed into the city, closely  
followed by still another machine. The  
mud-bespattered occupants, upon be­  
ing readily informed by Greenville cit­  
izens which way the negro had been  
carried, applied the power to their ma­  
chines and dashed on.  
Different Routes Taken.  
At Greenville the mob divided, some  
taking one road to Spartanburg and  
some another. Others took to the  
Laurens road, thinking, perhaps, that  
the officers would s&#x27;Dirit the naRglo to  
Fountain Inn or some station 0i the  
C. &amp; W. C. railway and place him~  
aboard a train for Columbia.  
Within an hour after the negro had  
been hurried through Greenv&#x27;ille, the  
lad \yho drove the machine reap­  
peared in the city, together with  
members of the local police force, who  
had accompanied the Anderson depu­  
ties when they left for Spartanburg.  
This led many to believe that the  
negro had been taken from the car  
when a few miles out of Greenville  
and concealed in the woods.  
Within a few minutes after the lad  
&amp;  
  
reappeared in Greenville, the ear,  
bearing Josh Ashley and his part.v  
rolled in sight. The pursuers had  
failed to overtake the party with the  
negro and were eviddntly on their way  
back to Anderson.  
Boy Forced to Reveal Hiding Place.  
Upon learning of the lad who irove  
the automobile being in the city, &quot;Cit­  
izen&quot; Josh Ashley instituted a search  
for him. The lad was chased into the  
rear of a drug store, where, despite  
the efforts of the police to protect  
him, Ashley and his crowd laid hands  
upon him.  
The lad was placed in Ashley&#x27;s ma- I

down the body and hold the inquest.  
The crime for which the negro  
was lynched tonight was committed  
about 7 o&#x27;clock this morning. The  
victim was the 11-year-old daughter  
of a prominent citizen of Honea  
Path.  
The child had gone to carry the  
cow to the pasture, a Quarter of a  
mile from her home. She was on  
one of the main roads, leading out of  
town and was seized and dragged into  
the woods about HO yards, where the  
attack was made, and it is feared  
that the negro accomplished his de?  
vilish purpose. In the woods there  
is every evidence of a fearful strug?  
gle.  
When the .hild was seized, her  
assailant threatened to kill her if  
she cried out to give alarm. Terrified  
with frieght, she desisted from her  
cries. It If thought that the noil 8  
of a buggy approaching along the  
road may have frightened the brute  
and that he let go his victim. A man  
from the country saw the negro  
come from th I woods, and seeing the  
child muddy ard crying, approached  
her and asked the trouble,  
The news quickly spread. Willis  
Jackton waa arrested on suspicion  
and taken before the victim. who  
positively Identified him, and as posi?  
tively said that iwn other suspects  
were not the guilty parties. Con?  
stable Hayes took th.- negro In an  
automol.il.&#x27; and hastened toward An?

The little girl was calm and posi?

considerably Injured, but li up and

platan when one of the suspects was  
taken to her fath&lt; r&#x27;t bom,-.

ter he left a telephone call to his of?  
fice from Piedmont stated that the  
automobile containing the nogro had  
just passed there and that about ten  
machines, containing the mob, were  
in close pursuit and were not more  
than 7 0 minutes behind.  
At 5 o&#x27;clock the Anderson automo?  
bile dashed through the streets of  
Greenville and up to the county jail  
door. At the Jail Sheriff Poole re?  
ceived a telephone messapre from  
Sheriff King at Anderson to spirit  
the negro on to Spartanburg. A  
change of automobiles was quickly  
made at the Jail and the flight to  
Spartanburg taken up.  
Within ten minutes after the auto?  
mobile bearing the negro had depart?  
ed a big Anderson touring car, con?  
taining Josh Ashley and four other  
men, steamed through Main street.  
&quot;Citizen&quot; Josh Ashley clutched a  
Winchester rifle in his hands and  
eagerly inquired where the negro  
had been taken. Upon being told  
that the party had proceeded to  
Spartanburg. the word &#x27; of command  
was given and the big automobile  
dashed on up the street. Within five  
minutes another Anderson car steam?  
ed into the city, closely followed by  
another machine, and the mud-be?  
spattered occupants, upon being  
readily informed by Greenville citi?  
zens what way the negro had been  
carried, applied the power to their  
machines and dashed away.  
At Greenville the mob divided,  
some taking one road to Spartanburg  
and some another, and others took  
to the Laurena road, thinking, per?  
haps, that the officers would spirit  
the negro to Fountain Inn or some  
station on the Charleston &amp; West?  
ern Carolina railway and place him  
aboard a train for Columbia.  
Within a hour after the negro had  
been hurried through Greenville the  
lad who drove the machine reap?  
peared in the city, together with  
members of the local police fores  
who bad accompanied the Anderson  
deputies when they left for Spartan?
