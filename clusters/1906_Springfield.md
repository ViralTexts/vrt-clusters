urned At Springfield, Mo.  
CITY IS UNDER MARTIAL LAW  
Race War That May Mean Much- Militia Called Out-Both Races Said to Be Armed.  
Springfield, Mo., April 16.-A mob of 3000 men and boys took two ne- groes, Horace Duncan and Jim Cope- land, from the Greene county jail shortly before midnight, Saturday, hanged them to the statute of the Goddess of Liberty in the public square, and then built a fire under the bodies.  
Two hours later the mob returned to the jail, took out another negro, Will Allen, accused of murder, and lynched him also.  
The two negroes first lynched were accused of assaulting Miss Mabel Ed- monson, a young white woman who came here from Monett, Mo., Friday, to work as a domestic.  
Miss Edmonson went driving Friday night with a man named Charles Cooper. In a secluded part of the city the couple were held up by two negroes. The man was knocked un- conscious and the girl dragged from the buggy and abused.  
Duncan and Copeland were suspect- ed and arrested. They were only par- tially identified, and their employer vouched for an alibi for them, but the mob was bent on vengeance and in no mood to discriminate between guilt and innocence.

und that the mob was led by Polk county people, from where Miss Edmonson was reared, but Sheriff Crane says that this is not true.  
Two months ago T. M. Kinney, a prominent tailor, was assassinated, and two negro suspects are in jail. Later an old peddler was killed, and negroes were accused of that. This created a strong anti-negro feeling.  
It was in fear that a tragedy would be enacted that caused a delegation of negroes to try to prevent the play, &quot;The Clansman,&quot; from being given here.  
Monett, Peirce City, Rogers, Ark., and several other towns around here have driven the negroes out, and they have congregated in Springfield. It is feared that they may be run out of here the same as in other cities, so bitter has become the feeling.  
Wrong Men Hanged.   
Springfield, Mo., April 16.-Quiet prevailed today and indications were that the race trouble is over. The presence of troops had the effect of bringing the people to a full realiza- tion of the situation.  
The last of the state militia ordered here by Governor Folk arrived early today. Six companies now patrol the streets.  
With the first appearance of soldiers last evening there came a revulsion of sentiment. Before midnight a decided reaction had set in. People began to condemn the action of the mobs that lynched the three negroes and burned their bodies.  
Today this feeling has gained strength, especially when it became thoroughly appreciated that Mabel Edmondson, the white domestic, had declared positively that Dunacn and Copeland, two of the negroes lynched, were not her assailants.  
This was also heightened by the ar- rival from Jefferson City of the as- sistant attorney sent by the governor to aid the county officials, in ferret- ing out and prosecuting the members of the mob, the rames of many of whom are known.  
Judge Lincoln, of the criminal court, today ordered a special grand jury convened Tuesday to make an inves- tigation of the lynching. The jury will be instructed to indict all leaders that may be apprehended. The better class of citizens is strong today in the demands that rioters be punished by the law.  
Under directions of Captain Willis, of Company H, Nevada, Mo., who is officer of the day, the soldiers pitched their tents today. Outposts were maintained during the night on all the principal streets leading to the jail. No disturbance of any kind was re- ported.  
Today negroes who had fled to the woods returned to their homes, and many others who had hidden them- selves in their homes appeared upon the streets.  
Crowds of people today still walked the streets, but no attempt was made to interfere with the negroes.  
All Danger Not Passed.  
Kansas City, April 16.-A special to the Star, written by a staff writer sent to Springfield, Mo., says:  
&quot;Notwithstanding the presence of troops, the streets today are full of people who approve the work of the mob and who damn all negroes, and advise that they be run out of town.   
&quot;All danger of mob violence has not passed. Hundreds of men openly curse and jeer the soldiers.  
&quot;Hundreds of men boldly utter the threat that if arrests are made the people will arise and rescue the ar- rested men, and drive the militia as well as the negroes out of the city.  
&quot;Everywhere this threat is heard, ‘This town is too small for niggers and whites to live in. One or the other must go.’  
&quot;A negro leaning against the court house with the torops near by remark- ed today, &#x27;Give the colored men guns! and we&#x27;ll show you.&#x27;  
&quot;Several white men threatened to close in upon the negro, when the officers hustled him off to jail.  
Troops to Remain There.   
Jefferson City, April 16.-Governor Folk at noon issued instructions to Adjutant General DeArmond to direct General H. C. Clark, in command of the militia at Springfield, to arrest the leaders of the Saturday night mob, put them in jail and surround the jail with troops for protection. governor stated that the militia would be kept at Springfield until quiet and order are restored.  
The Situation Summarized.  
The Globe-Democrat of this (Mon- day) morning had the following sum- mary of the situation:  
With six companies of state torops and 300 extra policemen on duty at Springfield, following the triple lynch- ing on Saturday night, the city is out- wardly quiet, but volcanic symptoms are manifest.  
Whites and blacks are reported as having armed themselves almost to the capacity of business houses to sup- ply them, and the negroes are said to have seized 300 sticks of dynamite from a rock quarry for defense pur- pose

hment to the lynchers.  
The Ministerial alliance of Spring- field, supported by scores of business and professional citizens, formally de- mands that the hand of justice fall upon the mob members, and calls a mass meeting for tonight to provide ways and means for the purpose in hand. Special indignation was arous- ed by the public offering for sale of grewsome relics of the riotous revel.  
Sheriff Horner, it is declared, did not telegraph Governor Folk of the condition prevailing until late Sunday afternoon. It is further reported that the sheriff, when the jail was assailed by the mob, ordered his men not to fire.  
Miss Edmondson, the attack upon whom provoked the lynching out- break, when told of the work of ven- geance, observed: &quot;Served them right.&quot; Her condition is pronounced serious.  
Will Alllen, the last of the trio lynched, was twice hanged, though the first is beli

SPRINGFIELD, Mo.. April 1G.?Quiet pre­  
vailed here today, and the indications were  
that the race trouble was over. The pres­  
ence of the troups has had the effect of  
bringing the people to a full realization of  
the situation. The last of the state militia  
ordered here by Gov. Folk arrived early to­  
day, and six companies now patrol the  
streets.  
With the first appearance of the soldiers  
last evening there came a revulsion of sen­  
timent. Before midnight a decided reac­  
tion had s&quot;et in and people began to con­  
demn the action of the mob that lynched  
the three negroes and burned their bodies.  
Today this feeling gained strength, espe­  
cially when it became thoroughly appre­  
ciated that Mabel Kdmondson, the white  
domestic, had declared positively that Dun­  
can and Copelar.d, two of the negroes  
lynched, were not her assailants.  
This also was heightened by the arrival  
from Jefferson City of an assistant attorney  
general, sent by Gov. Folk to aid the coun­  
ty officials in ferreting out and prosecuting  
the members of the mob, the names of  
many of whom are known.  
Special Grand Jury Called.  
Judge Lincoln of the criminal court or­  
dered a special grand jury convened on  
Tuesday morning. The jury will be instruct­  
ed to make a thorough investigation of  
the lynching and the other acts of the  
mob, and to indict all the leaders that may  
be apprehended.  
The better class of citizens were strong  
today In their demands that the rioters be  
punished to the full extent of the law, and  
every effort will be made to secure convic­  
tions.  
Under the direction of Capt. Willis of  
Company H of Nevada, Mo , who is the  
officer of the day, the soldiers pitched their  
tents today. Outposts were maintained  
during the night on all the principal streets  
leading to the jail. .  
No disturbance of any kind was reported.  
Today the negroes who tied to the woods  
returned to their homes, and many others,  
who had hidden themselves in their homes,  
appeared upon the streets.* Crowds of peo­  
ple today still walked the streets, passing  
from point to point of interest, but no at­  
tempt was made to interfere with the  
negroes

As Well as the Negroes and Drive  
  
Them From the City—Best People  
  
Deplore the Lynching.  
  
Springfield, Mo., April 16.—Quiet  
prevailed here today, and indications  
are that the race trouble is over. The  
presence of troops has had the effect  
of bringing the people to a full realiza­  
tion of the situation. Six companies  
now patrol the streets. [Details of the  
lynching are given on page 5.]  
  
With the first appearance of the sol­  
diers last evening there came a revul­  
sion of sentiment. Before midnight, a  
decided reaction had set in, and the  
people began to condemn the action  
of t&#x27;he mob that lynched the three ne­  
groes, and burned their bodies. Today  
this feeling has gained strength, es­  
pecially when it became thoroughly ap­  
preciated that Mabel Edmondson, a  
white domestic, had declared positively  
that Duncan and Copeland, the negroes  
lynched, were not her assailants. This  
feeling also was heightened by the ar­  
rival from Jefferson City of the as­  
sistant attorney general, sent by Gov­  
ernor Folk to aid the county officials in  
ferreting out and prosecuting the mem­  
bers of the mob, the names of many of  
whom are known.  
  
Judge Lincoln, of the criminal court,  
today ordered the special grand jury  
convened Tuesday. The jury will be  
instructed to make a thorough inves­  
tigation of the lynching and other acts  
of the mob, and to indict all the lead­  
ers apprehended. The better class of  
citizens were strong today In their de­

Springfield, to arrest the leaders of the

SPECIAL GRANT .KT.Y  
Is Called to Investigate Lawless Act  
of Springfield Mob.  
Springfield. Mo.. April 16. Quiet  
prevailed here today and the indica­  
tions were that the race trouble was  
over. The presence of the troops .has  
had the effect of bringing the people  
to a full realization of the situation.  
The last of the state militia ordered  
here by Governor Folk arrived early­

the streets. With the first appear­  
ance of the soldiers last evening there  
came a revulsion of sentiment. Be­  
fore midnight a decided reaction had  
set in and people began to condemn  
the action of the mob that lynched the  
three negroes and burned their bodies.  
Todav this feeling gained strength,  
especially when it became thoroughly  
appreciated that Mabel Edmonson, the  
white domestic, had declared positive­  
ly that Duncan and Copeland, two of  
the negroes lynched, were not her as­  
sailants. This also was heightened by  
the arrival from Jefferson City of an  
assistant attorney general, sent by­  
Governor Folk, to aid the county of­  
ficials in ferreting out and prosecuting  
the members of the mob. the names of  
many of whom are known.  
Judge Lincoln, of the criminal  
court, today ordered a special grand

SPKINUFIELD, Mo., April 1«.—Quiet  
prevailed here today and the indica­  
tions were that the race trouble was  
over. The presence of the troops has  
had the effect of bringing the people  
to a full realization of the situation.  
The last of the state militia ordered  
here by Governor Folk arrived early  
today and six companies now patrol  
the streets. With the first appearuuee  
of the soldiers last evening, there  
came a revulsion of sentiment. Before  
midnight a decided reaction had set Id,  
the people began to condemn the action  
of the mob that lynched the three  
negroes and burned their bodies. To­  
day this feeling gained strength,  
especially when it became known that  
Mabel Edwardson, the white domestic,

Prosecuting Attorney Patterson and  
Sheriff Horner are said to have se­  
cured the names of more than 100 men  
who took part in the lynching. The  
leaders of the mob were not disguised,  
but worked in the full glare of the  
electric lights on the square.  
  
TROOPS ON THE SCENE, &#x27;i  
  
Companies of 8tate Militia on Duty  
at Springfield.  
Springfield, Mo., April 16.—Quiet  
prevails here and the indications are  
that the race trouble is over. The  
presence of the troops has had the  
effect of bringing the people to a full  
realization of the situation. The last  
of the state militia ordered here by  
Governor Folk arrived early in the day  
and six companies now patrol tho  
streetB.  
  
With the first appearance of the sol­  
diers there came a revulsion of senti­  
ment. A decided reaction set in and  
people began to condemn the action of  
the mob that lynched the three ne­  
groes and burned their bodies. This  
feeling continues to gain strength, es­  
pecially as It has become thoroughly  
appreciated that Mabel Edmondson,  
the white domestic, has declared posi­  
tively that Duncan and Copeland, two  
of the negroes lynched, were not her  
assailants. This also was heightened  
by the arrival from Jefferson City of  
an assistant attorney general, sent by  
Governor Folk to aid the county offi­  
cials in ferreting out and prosecuting  
the members of the mob, the names of  
many of whom are known.
