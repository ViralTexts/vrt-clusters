“Negro and White Man lynched at Cairo” - The Semi-Weekly Advocate (Belleville, Illinois), 19 November 1909
P. Robin


With the Fourth Regiment, Illinois National Guard, in charge and martial law practically declared, Cairo was quiet as a Sunday Saturday.
Immediately upon the arrival of the militia the members were put on duty and general patrol of the city was begun. The presence of the troops brought quiet and restored a feeling of safety for the people are respect for the majesty of the law.
The arrival of militia companies from Casey and Shelbyville Friday night completed the military investment of the city. All of the militia companies were recalled by Tuesday with the exception of the Cairo company.
The Carbondale Company of the Fourth Regiment was the first on the scene. It arrived not a moment too soon for fifteen hundred men were searching the railroad yards and scouring the city for the negro, Arthur Alexander, who was charged by Will James, in his dying confession, of having assisted in the murder of MIss Anna Pelley. The militia quickly dispersed the mob. Not since the race riots at Springfield in August, 1908, has there been such an uprising of the people of Illinois was experienced at Cario,


Black and White Strung Up
William James was lynched last Thursday night for the brutal murder of Miss Anna Pelley, aged 24 years, the Cairo saleswoman, who he outraged and then choked to death in an alley near her home Monday night between 6 and 8 o’clock. He was hung upon his return to Cairo by his captors, who took him from Sheriff Davis and two of his deputies in the woods near Belknap, in Johnson county, thirty miles north of Cairo. Afterwards, his body was dragged through the streets to the alley where he murdered Miss Pelley and there cremated. 
After the lynching of James, the blood-thirsty mob stormed the county jail and took out Henry Salzner, a white man, accused of the murder of his wife, and hanged him to a telephone pole. The rope roke and his body was filled with bullets by members of the mob.


The Lynching of James
James was killed and burned after he confessed the murder of the shopgirl and implicated another negro. Salzner had nothing whatsoever to do with this crime. He was in a cell charged with the murder of his wife and his lynching was merely a sacrifice to the mob’s blood lust.
The mob that hanged James was led by women, many of the wives of influential residents of Cairo. The rope was pulled taut by female relatives of MIss Pelley, aided by several score of their sex. As the negro was pulled into the air, these same women sand and screamed with delight.
The men were for the most part spectators until the rope that was strangling the negro and his dying body fell to the ground. THen hundred of revolvers flashed and 500 bullets crashed into the quivering form of the negro. The riddled dead man was then dragged through the principal streets of the city to the spot where the Pelley girl was assaulted and slain.
Women applied the torch to the bonfire that had been prepared and into which the body of James was thrown. Then thousands cheered and danced at the scene.
James was lynched from an arch int the most conspicuous portion of the city, at Eighth and Commercial streets. Women and children living in the outlying sections of the town, elderly ladies  and even church workers gathered at the square and witnessed the hanging.
James pleaded piteously for his life, but his cries were drowned in the shout of derision from the men and the higher-toned screams of the women. Before the rope was pulled James implicated Arthur Alexander, another negro, in the attack on Miss Pelley. No sooner the other black’s name been mentioned than a large part of the mob detached itself, gave up the pleasure of seeing James dangling in the air, and started off to look for Alexander.


James Implicates Alexander.
James was found about 5 o’clock Thursday afternoon and the news was spread along the line to the scattered mob to board the Big Four train and meet them at Belknap. The whole party arrived at Cairo on the Big  Four train at 7:45 and the negro was taken off at Tenth street and marched right through the principal streets of the city to the most public location, under the city arch, at Eighth and Commercial streets. While in custody of the mob at Belknap and coming down on the train the negro would not tell about the crime, but when he stood under the arch he weakened and confessed and said Arthur Alexander, who was arrested Tuesday in East St. Louis, and afterwards released, was implicated in the crime.
The mob cae very near getting off the train before it reached Cairo and lynching James, but it was finally decided to take the negro into Cairo and give the people a chance there to help with the work.
The mob was so large that the resistance of the officers was fruitless. The negro James had been in Cairo off and on for several years. He came from the South. He said before being lynched that the assault on the girl had been committed before being murdered, and that Arthur Alexander had helped him with the crime, and that Alexander had some of her jewelry and effects. He admitted that he had outraged MIss Pelley before killing her.


Alexander Under Arrest
It develops that after Alexander was released by the East St. Louis police he returned to Cairo and was arrested and held by the police. 
Following the implication of Alexander by James the man was dressed in policeman’s clothes and spirited out of the city. Members of the mob kept up an all night search for the man but failed to locate him.


Lynching of Salzner and His Crime
Henry Salzner, the white man who was lynched at 11:40 o’clock by the mob, was a photographer  by trade and son of William Salzner, a Cairo hide and wool buyer.
The public was incensed against him, and while a part of the mob was scouring the city for the negro, Alexander, time hung heavy on the hands of the balance of the mob, and when some one suggested Salzner the mob rushed for the county jail, where the man wanted was held in the steel cage.
The sheriff and his crowd of deputies were pushed aside, and the battering down of the door of the cage was at once begun with  a sledge hammer that had been secured.
The mob found some difficulty in breaking the cage, as it is an entirely steel structure , but after a half hour of telling blows upon the door it give way and Salzner was taken. The mob rushed in out of the back door of the jail. 
The mob gave Salzner a chance to confess after the rope was around his neck, but he was so frightened that he could only mumble that his sisters did the killing.
They became furious at this , and it was hard work to keep them off Salzner long enough to give him a chance to pray. The mob finally subsided and a short religious service for the benefit of Salzner’s soul was held in a businesslike manner, after which he was strung up, the rope being placed over a telegraph pole at Twenty-first and Washington streets.
It is said Salzner gave his wife no money for food for herself and two small babies. One night last July Salzner’s wife was found at her home with her head broken in and a bloody ax was found under the bed, the two babies playing in the blood. Salzner had been seen by neighbors about the house early evening, and after the crime was discovered Salzner was found at the home of his mother, where he often sleep at night. All evidence pointed to Salzner as the murderer of his wife, and after the crime was discovered Mrs. Salzner recovered enough to accuse her husband of the crime.


Deneen Appealed to Too Late
While Governor Deneen ordered five companies of state militia to Cairo as soon as appealed to by SHeriff Davis upon the latter’s return to Cairo after the negro James had been taken from him at Belknap, the call come too late and there is an official responsibility to be placed for negligence.
Despite the fact that Sheriff Davis and his deputies had been virtually chased from ordinary avenues of transportation and forced to wander across country unfrequented bypaths, no intention of asking aid of Governor Deneen in protecting the prisoner had been shown by the local authorities of Cairo. Having outwitted the mobs thus far, Sheriff Davis and his deputies were hopeful of being able to keep the negro from the clutches of those seeking to wreak summary vengeance for the death of MIss Pelley.


The mayor and other Cairo authorities knew of the conditions at Cairo but they made no appeal to the governor for troops to put down the rioting.


Governor Orders Out Militia
It was not until 11 o’clock Thursday night that Governor Deneen who was at his rooms in the Union League Club at Chicago was notified by Sheriff Davis of the conditions at Cairo over long distance telephone:
Sheriff Davis said to the governors:
“The streets are filled with people and they are crazy. The are storming the jail now and trying to batter down the doors. I called for volunteers to help suppress the rioting and not a soul would help me. I must have troops.”
Governor Deneen immediately issued orders by telegraph to the following State troops: Company D, at Carbondale, Captain Galbraith; Company G, at Effingham, Captain Austin; Company M, at Champaign, Captain Smith; Company A, at Casey, Captain Steiner; Company B, at Newton, Captain McKinnon.        
“I have ordered Company D at Carbondale and Company G at Effingham, to proceed with all possible speed,” said Governor Deneen after his telephone conference with Sheriff Davis.
Later Sheriff Davis wired Governor Deneen that the mob had lynched both James and Salzner. 
Governor Deneen assured the sheriff that troops were on the way.
“The entire Fourth Regiment will be there in the morning,” said the Governor, “and order must be restored. I will not tolerate any quibbling with such lawlessness.” 
The troops ordered in the second command from the Governor were: Company I, Vandalia, Captain Bullington; Company K. Shelbyville, Captain Klausen; Company L. Olney, Captain Coen; Company D, Paris, Captain Cady; Company F, Mount Vernon, Captain Satterfield.


Funeral of Miss Pelley.
There were two funeral services for Miss Pelley.
The first was held at St. Patrick’s church at Cairo. All business in the city was suspended during the services at the church and Mayor Parsons and members of the city council served as honorary pall bearers.
It required several wagons to convey the floral emblems. The church was crowded and hundreds turned away.
The services included two beautiful solos by MIss Myrtle Bambrick and Joseph McNulty. Miss Bambrick sang “Face to Face,” and Mr. McNulty’s song was “Calvary.”


What Father Downey Said.
In his remarks at the funeral Father J. J. Downey spoke as follows:
What shall I say to express your thoughts, your grief, and the sorrow that overwhelms you today? What shall I say in the presence of those honored remains to bring some consolation to so many broken hearts?
What shall I say to express the sorrow of the people for this terrible crime?
On Monday last everything was peace and happiness. In a few hours the hand of the assassin intervened and everything was turned into confusion and grief.
Cairo has been unfortunate for the last two or three years. We have had here a series of abominable crimes. Human blood has flowed through the streets on more occasions than one. Widows and orphans cry aloud for redress, but cry in vain and why?
        Unhappy and unfortunate is the community that does not respect the laws of the land, and permit me to tell you that the laws will not be respected unless they are enforced. Honest judges and honest juries constitute the foundation of the peace and happiness of a people because they have the administration of the law, and when the law is justly administered, then it commands respect. Then every citizen bows his head to the majesty of the law. Nothing confers a more salutary effect on a community than the strict and just administration and strict observance of the law. Let every citizen take an interest in civic affairs; support men with honest convictions, men who will punish every offender. Then our homes and our people are safe. Then we can breathe the free air of liberty and safety. Such dreadful crimes as that of Monday will be unknown to our people. Confidence will be restored, virtue will be respected, and peace and security will again reign in our midst.
        The world has nothing superior to a virtuous and upright young lady. She is the light and comfort of the home. She is the consolation of parents, she is the guardian angel of the family. She is the pride and honor of companions.
        Her words, her actions, her ideas, kindle truth and affection in all hearts, and my dear friends, you will hear me out, such a young lady was Miss Pelley. She was a credit to any home. From the very day that she became a member of this congregation until the hour when she was struck down by the wretched assassin, her conduct was such as any congregation might feel proud. She represented that splendid class of young ladies who make their living by honest effort and endeavor. She had the intestimable advantage of good home training and she certainly was true to the traditions of her home.

        The funeral of Miss Pelley was held at Anna, at 2:30 Thursday afternoon from the St. Mary’s church. Father Downey, of Cairo, with fifty mourners accompanied the body to Anna on the fast Illinois Central train reaching Anna at 12:35 p.m. The train was met by a large crowd. 
The high school was closed, as she had been a member of the junior class of 1901 and held a place in the basket ball team. The floral tributes were profuse, one large vehicle being used for the conveyance of them alone.
        The body was laid to rest in the Anna cemetery beside the remains of Miss Pelley’s parents, a sister and a brother.

Alexander Escorted Out of City.
While a mob of several hundred persons screamed “Kill him” and “He’ll come back,” and 500 militia men protected him on all sides, Arthur Alexander, held as a suspect in the murder of Miss Anna Pelley, was marched to a special train Friday afternoon at 5 o’clock.
With two companies of militia aboard the train whose every window bristled with the bayonets of the soldiers, the negro was hurried away from the blood-mad city, and Cairo had no lynching Friday night. There was nobody in the jail to be hanged.
        Despite the presence in Cairo of nine companies of militia and proclamation of martial law, crowds of infuriated men congregated about the court house during the afternoon, to be dispersed at bayonet points. Convinced that the presence of ALexander in the jail meant another lynching and possible bloodshed in a conflict between the soldiers and the mob, Brigadier General F.B. Wells and the Colonel R. J. Shand decided that the man must be gotten out of town during the day. This plan was put into effect shortly after the arrival of the two officials Thursday afternoon at a time when the crowds about the building was the thickest.
The square about the court house was cleared by three companies at quickstep and while the crowd was still wondering what was coming, Alexander appeared in the main entrance, flanked on either side by deputy sheriffs. Preceded by two companies and followed by five others, the heavily manacled negro was escorted to the depot by a howling mob.
His appearance was the signal for yells of erosion, with many cries for his life.
The military cavalcade, in which the cringing negro was almost completely swallowed up, proceeding in open formation, swept the street ocean from building lien to building line, but the crowd closed in behind and continued its demonstration of hate and baffled rage or shouted from the roofs of the buildings. Even the negroes seemed to enjoy the spectacle.
A special train on the Illinois Central was waiting at the levee intersection of Twentieth street, down which the march was made, and five minutes after the prisoner arrived the train departed, destination unknown, except that it is far enough from Cairo to prevent a repetition of Thursday night’s tragedy, when WIlliam James was captured and brought back within a few miles of safety. Companies G, of Effingham, and M, of Champaign, accompanied the party, which included two deputy sheriffs.
        Alexander is supposed to have been implicated in the assault and murder of Miss Pelley by James just before the latter met a hideous death. Confirmation of James’ confession is lacking, but Alexander is held as a suspect.
        He was captured Thursday night when the lynching of Jmaes was in full swing and while the crowd was thirsting for his blood. He was arrested at the home of Julia Osborne, at No. 513 North Nineteenth street, asleep. Although a thousand men were searching the city for him to burn him on the same pyre with James, he was spirited through the heart of the mob by Patrolman Ally Frost, a negro, desguised in a patrolman’s uniform.
        WIth the immediate cause of more trouble removed, Cairo is settling down to consider the events of the past few days and the results. As a general thing, the city appears to be well satisfied with itself over the summary demise of James and Henry Salzner, the popular sentiment being that it was a good job well done.
        As to possible legal entanglements for those who participated in the lynchings, no one is taking much concern.
        Whatever may be the ultimate outcome of the riots, the officials are not laying awake nights collecting evidence. State’s Attorney Wilson solemnly announced Friday that he will proceed when he determines what his procedure should be in the premises. He said that the matter certainly will be taken up by the December grand jury, because such an affair could not be overlooked. Asked if a special grand jury might be impanelled, he said it might if Circuit Judge Wm. N. Butler would call one, Judge Butler is traveling his circuit and Mr. Wilson could not say definitely when he would return to Cairo.
        The coroner’s jury impanelled to consider the killings of James and Salzner returned a popular verdict Friday night, “that the defendants came to their death by injuries received from the hands of parties unknown to us.”
        The same jury acted in each case, the members being business and professional men. Jos. W. Wenger, a special railroad agent, was foreman. The other members were: Samuel White, merchant; H.C. Lewis, commercial agent; H.R. Aisthrope, banker; Elmer C. Owrey, steamboat captain. The proceedings were purely formal and lasted but a few minutes.
        State’s Attorney WIlson told Friday night that he narrowly escaped being mobbed during the excitement. He said he was in the thick of the melee, but was forced to flee when he was recognized.
