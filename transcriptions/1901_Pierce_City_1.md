REPUBLIC SPECIAL
Pierce City, Mo., Aug. 20.--Quiet has succeeded excitement and the terrible scenes of the last three days, and it is believed there will be no further bloodshed. However, if negroes suspected of the murder of Miss Wilde and now under arrest in different cities were brought here to-night, there is not the slightest doubt that their lives would pay the forfeit if their connection with the crime could be established. 
For nearly fifteen hours, ending at noon to-day, this town of 3,000 people had been in the hands of a mob of armed whites, determined to drive every negro from its precincts.
In addition to the lynching last night of Will Godley, accused of the wanton murder of Miss Gazelle Wilde, and the shooting to death of his grandfather, French Godley, the mob to-day cremated Pete Hampton, a negro, in his home, set the torch to the houses of five blacks, and with the aid of the State militia rifles, stolen from the local company's arsenal, drove dozens of negroes from town. After noon the excitement died down, the mob gradually dispersing, more from lack of negroes upon which to wreak their hatred than from any other cause.
Many Negroes in Hiding.
Many of the negroes who fled the city are hiding in the surrounding woods, while others have gone greater distances in seeking safety. Every negro has left the town, except a few railway porters, known to be respectable, but who must also leave.
The citizens of Pierce City say that, as negroes have committed several such crimes in the last ten years, none shall live there in the future, the same feeling already existing at Monnett, four miles east of Pierce City, and the end of a Frisco division. It may be necessary to change all porters in Springfield hereafter.
It is now believed that the man Will Goodley was not the real culprit. A negro named Starks, under arrest at Tulsa, I. T., across the border from here, tallies exactly with the description of the murderer. He is held there awaiting identification. Unless the man is bought back here it is believed there will be no further trouble. If returned here, he will surely be lynched.
