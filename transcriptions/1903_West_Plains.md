Negroes Leave West Plains. 


Howell County Gazette: West Plains, Mo., Aug. 10, 1903. Pony Thomas, ‘
Niggers, take warning. You one and all must be out of this country by September 20, or old niggers will be killed and their children sold as slaves. 
YOURS IN EARNEST.
The receipt of the above letter two weeks ago by Pony Thomas, caused great excitement in Coontown and the one hundred and twenty-five colored inhabitants of that part of West Plains at once began making arrangements to leave. But the excitement subsid- ed and would have died out entirely had no other message of warning reached Coontown. Monday George Shaw, the oldest negro in the colony, received a letter that caused a general exodus. The letter read:
West Plains, Mo., Aug. 29, 1903,
George Shaw.
Please don't forget the notice that you niggers received some time ago to leave this country by the first of September. Now, George, tell all your darkey friends that they want to be making preparations to leave this country, because we mean for you to go, and you must do it. Re- member there are three hundred and fifty of us whites. And we have got the arms and ammunition and the backbone to back what we say. Now, George, be sure and spread the news among your colored brothers and don't let the sun go down on you after the first of September in West Plains.
YOURS IN EARNEST.
The hand writing in both letters was identical. It appeared to have been the work, of a woman, but was probably instigated by some man. A desire for revenge is the motive as- signed for the sending of these anony- mous letters, for it is evident that wohever sent the messages had malice toward the blacks.
It took but a short time for the news to spread among the colored popula- tion. Colored cooks and washwomen refused to perform their duties, the negro hod carriers working on build- ings left their work and porters in the saloons threw up their jobs. They couldn't rest with a hoodoo hanging over them.
"We'se calculatin' on gittin' out ob heah quick as we can,” remarked an old negro who had never harmed a soul. "But if de white folks want us to stay dey must protect us," he added.
No inducement could make many of the blacks stay. Of course, some, who had nothing to fear, or, perhaps, have no sing for which to answer, paid lit- tle attention to the mysterious mes- sages. They declared their intention to remain and have armed themselves and will shoot if they are attacked by the unknown foe.
All day Tuesday a continual stream of travel passed too and from Coon- town across the Frisco tracks to the business part of the city. It was a busy day for second hand dealers and draymen. The former bought good for a song, while the latter reaped a harvest hauling trunks and furni- tture to the depot and stores. A num- eber o fthe blacks left their furniture in their homes and took the first train, caring little where they went, just so they got far from West Plains.
