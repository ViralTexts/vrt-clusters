DROVE THEM OUT.
Italians at Spring Valley Carry Out Their Resolution of Eviotion.
Authorities Stand Idly By and See Most Atrocious Outrages Committed-Negroes Preparing for an Armed Resist- ance-The Governor to Act.
PRINCETON, Ill., Aug. 6-The Italians of Spring Valley broke out Sunday in a war upon the negroes with a view of either massacreing them or driving them from within the city limits.
The Italians for many months have wished to drive the negroes out of the coal mining belt and Sunday a plausi- ble excuse for so doing presented it- self. At 1 o'clock Sunday morning an Italian was held up on the public highway by four negroes, robbed and shot four times, from the effects of which his physician says he cannot live.
A mass meeting of the Italians was called and at 10 o'clock a mob of over 300 that gathered started out for the negro village which is located 2 miles west of Spring Val- ley. They were headed by the Spring Valley Italian band and to deceive the negroes into thinking the assembly a peaceable one this band rendered several national an- thems. The negroes as a result re- mained in their homes, and the Italians fell into them like a lot of Apache In- dians.
The men were dragged out, clubbed, trampled upon and made the targets for the shotguns, rifles and small arms the mob had brought with them. The women were insulted, slapped and two of them while begging for mercy were shot down and fatally injured.
Lawlessness Reigns Supreme.
PRINCETON, Ill., Aug. 7.-The rioters and the lawless held sway in Spring Valley Monday night. No arrests or attempts at arrests have been made and those anarchistically inclined are in high spirits. The mobs commenced operations Monday by stopping work at the various coal shafts, and during the entire day the streets swarmed with men and further depredations are expected at any time. All day both sides engaged in the bloody riots of Sunday were organizing their men and preparing for further displays of force. The aid of the law as yet has not been successfully evoked on either side, and if the belligerent parties attempt to carry out the reso- lutions adopted by them Monday blood- shed cannot be averted.
Italians Carry Out Their Threat.
PRINCETON, Ill., Aug. 8.-The Italian miners of Spring Valley made an at- tempt to carry out their resolution to expel all the colored people remaining in the city, and the result was one of the most disgraceful outrages ever perpetrated in Bureau county. In- nocent women and children were driven from their homes, abused, in- sulted and their trunks and belong- ings dragged about and despoiled. The affair outside of Spring Valley has created a sensation and the news spread rapidly. Condemnations of the proceedings are coming from every quarter.
The Mayor Looks On.
During part of the time Martin Del- margo, the Italian mayor, accompanied by several Italian members of the po- lice, were on the grounds watching the proceedings. Mayor Delmargo said he was there to see that the ne- groes got away peaceably, but if this was his purpose, he did not accomplish what he went for.
Governor Makes Inquiries.
Gov. Altgeld has interested himself in the matter, and it is hoped by the friends of law and order that the reign of mob law in Spring Valley will soon be at an end. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon Sheriff Clark, of Princeton, received a message from him. In it the governor asked for information on the subject, and wished to know what was being done,by the officers of the law.
Sheriff Clark replied, giving a brief history of the events that have trans- pired, being substantially in accord- ance with the reports printed in these columns. He also said the authorities in Spring Valley were doing nothing and that he had not even been called upon by the mayor for assistance.
Will Not Concede Their Demands.
In reply to the demands of Italian miners that no negroes be employed in the future in the mines at Spring Valley, M. H. Taylor, of Erie, Pa., president of the company, telegraphed the following:
"ERIE. Pa, Aug. 6, 1895.-To S. N. DALZELL. General Manager Spring Valley Coal Company: Dear Sir: While the company disclaim any desire or intention of antag- onizing any section of their employes. It can- not be delegated to any one section the right of selection for employment and therefore the demands made by the Italian miners that no colored miners should be employed cannot be acceded to The violence charged to the three colored miners is deplored, but is nothing as to which the company can be held responsible for any more than the violence of white miners as is reported. Post this, a reply to the de- mand, with hopes of an early resumption of work, when the present acute, but wrongly di- rected ill-feeling of the Italian miners sub- sides. 
(Signed) H. M. TAYLOR, "President."
Negroes Promised Support.
The negroes are assembled princi- pally at Seatonville and received tele- grams from members of their race in Chicago and Peoria that gave them great encouragement. The purport of these telegrams were to stand firm and assist- ance would soon be forthcoming. The negroes during the last few days have procured a number of shotguns and small arms, and if more can now be secured they propose to march to Spring Valley, occupy their homes, and resume their employment with the coal company.
Among the negroes at Seatorville are six bearing shot wounds and four who are laid up with bruised heads and shoulders from the clubbings they re- ceived Sunday.
Call to Arms.
CHICAGO, Aug. 8.-In response to a call to arms addressed to the colored people of Chicago over 200 negroes as- sembled at 500 State street at 9 o'clock Tuesday morning.
There were many representative col- ored citizens in the crowd, but the great majority were of the disreputa- ble element. There was constant dis- order, but no weapons were displayed. Policemen in citizens clothes cir- culated freely in the crowd. Many inflammatory speeches were made during the day.
Gov. Altgeld Heard From.
Tuesday evening during a meeting of the negroes at Arlington hall a telegram was received from Gov. Altgeld promising that the negroes at Spring Valley would be protected in the exercise of their legal rights. A telegram was also received from the mayor of the lawless town, inviting a delegation of colored citi- zens to visit the place and investigate the affair. The invitation was ac- cepted, and a committee of five ap- pointed to go there at once.
Sent to Investigate.
SPRINGFIELD, Ill., Aug. 8.-Gov. Alt- geld has dispatched Col. Hugh E. Boyle, assistant adjutant general, and George Schilling, secretary of the state bureau of labor statistics, to Spring Valley, to thoroughly investi- gate the situation and report to him.
PEORIA, Ill., Aug. 8.-The colored men of Peoria are organized, and it seems probable that a delegation of at least a score will leave for Spring Val- ley, where they will tender their services to the sheriff to assist in the protection of the colored men against the Italians.
