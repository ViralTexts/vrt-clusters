“Negro Rapist was Lynched After Confessing his Crime” - The Anderson Daily Mail (Anderson, South Carolina), 11 October 1911 (first photo)

“Prisoner Was Taken from Officers After an Exciting Chase Through Three Counties.”
The Negro Was Carried to Honea Path Last Night, and After Being Identified by His Victim, He Confessed to His Crime - He Was Then Swung to a Telephone Pole and His Body Riddled With Bullets - About Five Hundred Persons Took Part in the Lynching.
-
        Carried back to Honea Path from a point seven miles beyond Greenville, and again identified by his child victim, and confessing the crime as he sat upon the log in the woods, by the side of which it occurred, Willis Jackson, colored, aged 17 years, was swung to a telephone pole, half a mile beyond Honea Path at 11.25 o’clock Tuesday night, and his body riddled with bullets.
        It is estimated that there were at least 5,000 people in the crowd who witnessed the execution, those having assembled from all over Anderson, from adjacent counties, every possible means of conveyance being used to get to the scene. The body of the negro was left hanging to the post. The mob, after finishing the work in hand, dispersed quietly, and 30 minutes later not one was found to be near the scene.
        Officers Poole and Martin, in charge of the prisoners, were overtaken near Paris Station, Greenville county, about 5:30 o’clock in the afternoon. Jackson was hustled into an automobile and hurried toward Honea Path, the mob being determined to take before the victim for identification. Back through Greenville, on to Belton and through to Honea Path, the mob headed, and on arrival there quick work was made of the negro.
        There was a great crowd of people who went down from Anderson to Belton on the 9.20 car Tuesday night, arriving there just in time to see the mob, in automobiles, speed through the town, each car traveling at the rate of about 25 or 30 miles an hour. There were also several auto parties made up here, who went to Honea Path, a number of Anderson people witnessing the lynching.
        Every move made by the mob was made in the most orderly manner after the arrival at Honea Path. The negro was taken straight through the town to the home of the child victim, possibly a quarter of a mile from the business section, where he was again identified. From here he was taken to the scene of the crime, in a grove nearby, and seated upon a log about which there was every evidence of a terrible struggle earlier in the day. Jackson confessed this crime.
        He said that he had committed the deed, was sorry for it; and begged for mercy at the hands of the mob. He recalled the evening of the earlier part of the day, telling how he had attacked the girl; and wishing that he had the time again before him saying that he would never be guilty of such a crime.
        After his confession, a small plow line was placed about the left ankle of the negro and he was carried from the woods, across the road, exactly opposite the spot where the crime was committed, and hanged to the crossarm of a telephone pole. The negro was hoisted about 15 feet from the ground and hung there for several minutes begging for mercy, before an end was put to his existence by a load from a shotgun.
        Each man of the mob seemed to act for himself after the arrival with the negro at the scene of the crime. There appeared to be no active leader, but each man seemed already to have had an understanding with the others. Circling the pole to which the negro hung by a foot, the mob was lined up on every side, and when the first gun was fired, there was a general [?]. 
        The negro’s shirt had been removed before he was swung up to the pole, and his bodyfrom the waist line down, was literally riddled with bullets. It is said that there was something like 2,000 shots fired by the crowd, these following immediately after the firing of the first gun which is believed to have put an end to the negro’s existence.
        The members of the mob and others who witnessed the lynching, remained possibly 20 minutes on the scene, and then quietly dispersed, leaving the mutilated body of the negro boy swinging to the pole, where it remained until Coroner Beasley arrived there today for the purpose of holding an inquest. There was no disorder of any kind following the lynching, every member of the mob seemed to have been perfectly satisfied, and willing to go home.
        Willis Jackson, the negro lynched, was said to be about 17 years old, and was rather small for his age. He wore knee pants and was bare-footed. The rope by which he was hauled up the post was fastened to the left ankle, and after shots fired by the mob had ended his life, he swung against the post, facing toward the town of Honea Path.
        Deputy Sheriff V. B. Martin of this city, who with Sheriff Perry Poole of Greenfville, had charge of the negro he had acted just as he should have; that there was no chance, under the circumstances, and great odds against him, to protect the prisoner from the mob.
[?] when he was taken by the mob, arrived here Tuesday night at 10.10 on the [?]. He had been carried as far as Belton, by members of the mob in an automobile and there made to get out. Within a short time he caught an inter-urban car, arriving here at 10:35.
        Deputy Martin said that he had done all he could: the mob had surrounded and overpowered him, and had carried away the negro. Nothing more could have been done by any officer, and the crowd on the car was not slow in telling Officer Martin that he had acted just as he should have; that there was no chance, under the circumstances, and great odds against him, to protect the prisoner from the mob.
        Officers Poole and Martin were come upon by the mob in the woods seven miles beyond Greenville about 5:30 in the afternoon. With the prisoner, the officers had started out from Greenville in an automobile, but it was soon seen that the machine being used was too slow, making only about 15 miles an hour at best.
        Realizing that the mob was less than five minutes behind them, Officer Martin had the driver run the car on to the side of the road and there he and Sheriff Poole got out with the negro hiding the in the woods. The driver of the car was sent back to Greenville, and through him the mob learned of the whereabouts of the negro. This was about 2:30 o’clock.
        From his position in the woods, Officer Martin says he saw the machines, bearing members of the mob, go by like the wind. But there were some of them that turned back, among them Hon. J. W. Ashley, who was one of the leaders of the party when they passed through Anderson; and be learned that the lad who had taken the officers and the negro out of Greenville, had returned.
        After a search, the boy was found, and with guns in his face, he was made to tell where the negro was. This he did; but the mob was not yet satisfied and forced the boy to go with them to the spot where the officers had been last seen, about seven miles from Greenville.
        About 5:30 o’clock, while Officer Martin was alone with the negro in the woods, Sheriff Poole having gone to a nearby house to arrange to get a team, the first members of the mob made an appearance. Surrounding the spot were Deputy Martin and the negro, guns were thrown on him - 27 or more of them of all kinds. When Sheriff Poole came out of his return from the house, he found it all up, and said so. He realized fully as Deputy Martin, that there was no chance to keep the prisoner, and he was turned over.
        Sheriff Poole and Deputy Martin each took an arm of the negro and marched him to the machine of Mr. Ashley. Officer Martin was allowed to get into this machine also, and rode with the party. Sheriff Poole being taken back to Greenville, through which city the mob passed, enroute to Honea Path, about 7.30 o’clock.
        According to Deputy Martin there was little disorder in the mob. He was told in a quiet, business like manner of the intention of the mob - to take the prisoner out there was nothing to do but to turn him over which the officers did with the best peace.
        From the scene of the rapture Officer Martin rode with the negro until the mob pushed a point about a mile from Belton. Here the party stopped for a few minutes, and Mr. Martin was put out of the car with Jackson, being given a seat in the fourth or fifth car of the procession. At Belton he was put out of this car, and came here on the trolley.
        It was feared by the mob that the militia had been called out and stationed at Belton for the purpose of retaining the prisoner. The leaders reasoned that this would probably prevent the lynching, if Officer Martin was seen in a car as naturally the car would be the first to be held up, on the assumption that the negro was also a passenger in it.
        Jackson was placed in the first of the dozen cars bearing members of the mob, and this with several cars immediately behind it, passed through Belton traveling at 30 or 40 miles an hour, it had been arranged that in case the militia was encountered, a fast start would be gotten, and the speed continued through Belton.
        The car in which Officer Martin rode was slowed down in front of the Belton hotel, and the officer put out. He was told by the mob that he would not be carried further, as his presence would not be needed at the lynching. Deputy Martin said that he knew he could do no good by causing trouble and had not the slightest chance to save the negro, so quietly submitted to the demands of the mob.
        When surrounded by members of the mob near Greenville, Officers poole and Martin had been in the woods with the negro for something like three hours. They had seen the mob pass, and then return, having lost the train, and Mr. Martin says the negro could have gotten safely to jail somewhere had it not been for the fact that the driver of the car out of Greenville told the mob of their whereabouts.
        Sheriff W. B. King and Coroner J. F. Beasley have gone to Honea Path today to take down and arrange for the funeral of the body. Coroner Beasley will view the body and an inquest may be held.


May Have Been Wrong Negro
        There are many people in Anderson a number of them among those who went in Honea Path to witness lynching, who believe that Willis Jackson, the negro lynched, was the wrong man. Officer V. B. Martin, who was with the negro boy from the time he was taken from the jail until he was caught beyond Greenville, is one of those who share this belief.
        It was said today by two of the Anderson people who arrived at Honea Path before the mob reached there with the negro, that members of the family of the victim, refused to allow the negro to be brought into the house to be again identified; [?] the some [?] appeared on the porch and called out to the mob that Jackson was the right man, and asking [?] to be taken away and killed at [?].
        The negro’s victim is readily recovering from bodily injury and shock in lowing the assault, under the care of physicians. It is not thought now that their condition is in any dangerous.
An inquest was held today at Honea Path by Coroner J. K. Beasley over the body of the negro rapist Willia Jackson. The coroner in company was Sheriff W. B. King, went in Honea Path this morning, and arrangements were at once made and the inquest held. The verdict returned by the jury was to the effect that the deceased came to his death at the hand of a mob.


Negro Is Severely Whipped.
Milt Mattison, a negro living south of Honea Path, was given a severe whipping at the lumber mill at Honea Path this morning by Mr. Josh Ashley, as the result of the negro having ordered Mr. Ashley to move his automobile out of the road, so that the negro could pass, saying that he had as much right to the road as anybody.
        The trouble first began at the scene of Tuesday night’s lynching, where crowd of some 200 or 300 people had gathered, and, where arrangements were being made by Coroner J. Hoagley and Sheriff W. B. King for the inquest. The road was blocked when the negro tired to pass en route to Honea Path for a load of lumber.
Sheriff King told the negro to go and say no more. He went to the lumber mills, and shortly afterward was followed, there by Mr. Ashley and another Honea Path citizen, who administered a severe beating. Mr. Ashley was placed under bond.
A phone message from Honea Path this afternoon said that all is now quiet there, no more disorder of any kind is expected.


Driver is Run Down.
        The Greenville News had the following this morning: 
        At [?]:30 o’clock the Anderson automobile dashed through the streets of Greenville and up to the county jail door. At the jail, Sheriff Poole received a telephone message from Sheriff King at Anderson to spirit the negro on to Spartanburg. A change of automobiles was made at the jail and the flight to Spartanburg taken up. Within ten minutes, after the automobile bearing the negro had departed a big Andeson touting car, obtaining Josh Ashley and four other men steamed through Main street. “Citizen” Josh clutching a Winchester rifle in his hand and eagerly inquired where the negro had been taken. Upon being told that the party had proceeded to Spartanburg, the world of command was given and the big auto dashed onto the street. Within five minutes, another Anderson car steamed into the city, closely followed by another machine. The mud bespattered on [?], upon being readily informed by Greenville citizens which was the negro had been carried, applied the power to their machines and dashed on. At Greenville the mob divided, some taking one road to Spartanburg and some another. Others took to the Laurens road, thinking perhaps that the officers would spirit the negro to Fountain Inn, or some station on the C & W C. railway and place him aboard a train for Columbia.
        Within an hour after the negro had been hurried through Greenville and the lad who drove the machine reappeared in the city, together with members of the local police force who had accompanied the Anderson deputies when they left for Spartanburg. This led many to believe that the negro had been taken from the car when a few miles out of Greenville and concealed in the woods. Within a few minutes after the lad reappeared. In Greenville, the car bearing Josh Ashley and his party rolled in sight. The pursuers had failed to overtake the party with the negro and were evidently on their way back to Anderson. Upon learning of the lad who drove the automobile being in the city, Citizen Josh Ashley instituted a search for him. The lad was chased into the rear of a drug store, where, despite the efforts of the police to protect him, Ashley and this crowd laid hands upon him. The lad was placed in Ashley’s machine and carried back toward Spartanburg.


The Spartanburg End
Spartanburg, Oct. 11. When the news reached Spartanburg yesterday afternoon that
Willis Jackson, 17 years old negro, accused of having attacked an 11-year-old white girl at Honea Path, was being brought to the Spartanburg jail in an automobile and that the officers in charge of him were being pursued by a mob of 75 to 100 men, also in automobiles, who were bent on lynching the negro, there was considerable excitement here.
        The news first became generally [?] were among the foreigners. No word of their fate has been received.
        The military commander was killed by a [?]


Negro Rapist Was Lynched

(Continued from first page)


[?] known when Sheriff W. J. White and Capt. Moss Hayes and Sergt. S. J. Alverson, of the police department, were seen to leave the city hurriedly in an automobile. They left in response to the following message received by Sheriff White from Sheriff W. B. King, of Anderson county.


Message to Sheriff.
“Sheriff White, Spartanburg, S.C.:
        “Am trying to reach you with negro charged with assault, by automobile. Try and take care of him till my man can get off to Columbia.
“W. B. King, sheriff”
        Promptly upon receipt of this message Sheriff White secured an automobile and with the police officers mentioned started out the national highway in the direction of Greenville. He had in the meanwhile ascertained that the officers on their way here from Greenville were being pursued by a mob in automobiles.
        Shortly after Sheriff White and police officers left. [?] - R. H. Nesbitt, an automobile dealer, and Eugene Sanders, a newspaper man, also started in the direction from which, it was thought, the officers in charge of Jackson, would come.


No News at Duncan.
When the Spartanburg party reached Duncan without meeting the officers with Jackson, SHeriff White paused long enough to telephone back to Spartanburg to learn if anything further had been heard. He failed to obtain any additional information and continued in the direction of Greenville.
        At Greer Sheriff White learned through a telegram sent over the railroad wire, that Sheriff Poole of Greenville county had been so closely pressed by the mob when he reached Taylor that he had abandoned his automobile and taken to the woods with Jackson. The woods were surrounded by the mob. Mr. White was informed.
        Sheriff White and the others of the party then proceeded to Taylor, as the sheriff thought he might be of assistance to the Greenville sheriff. When Taylor was reached however, it was found that the mob had taken the negro and Sheriff Poole had returned to Greenville. Sheriff White telephoned to Sheriff Poole and was told briefly what had happened.
        Sheriff White and the others then returned to Spartanburg.


The Story From Honea Path.
        Honea Path, Oct. 11: Stiff and Stark, riddled with shots, the lifeless body of Willis Jackson is hanging to a telephone post near the scene of the crime yesterday morning. The crowd of angry men has had its way. The tide of passion which swept all reason, before it has passed, and this morning beyond the interest of the curious the town has assumed its wonted quiet.
        Willis Jackson was arrested at first on suspicion, and because he met with the description which the outraged girl gave of her assailant. When he was taken before her she positively and without hesitation identified him. Constable Haynes did a fine piece of work of spiriting him away to Anderson. The excited throng by automobiles and train, began to make their way to Anderson bent on revenge. Fearing for the safety of the prisoner, Sheriff King spirited him away by automobile in the direction of Greenville, closely followed by several automobiles. In Greenville it did not seem safe to lodge him in the jail, so it was planned to carry him out in the woods, in some way the pursuers discovered the plan and ten miles beyond Greenville, in the direction of Spartanburg, they discovered the negro Jackson, hid in a brush pile and brought him back here.
        A phone message was received here about 11 o’clock last night that Jackson was in the hands of his pursuers and was being brought back and a crowd quickly gathered which awaited the coming of the party with feverish anxiety, in twelve automobiles, everyone loaded to its capacity, the angry throng of determined men came into town about 11 o’clock. In all there was a gathering of not less than five hundred men on the streets. Mayor Sullivan, J. W. Ashley and James Black, [?] of the child, endeavored in vain to persuade the mob to let the law take its course. Having gotten the prisoner in their hands they would hear to no reasoning, but took him again before the little girl, who again identified him, crying out to take him away, and saying that she did not want to see him. Quickly, then, he was carried to the scene of the crime, drawn up to a telephone post by one [?], and riddled with a volley of shots, which awoke the stillness of the field. Beyond being blindly determined to carry out their unlawful purpose, and so beyond the appeal of reason, the crowd was orderly.
        The negroes have maintained a quiet and awed demeanor. A number of them have been to see the body. The better class of them, of which there are not a few in this community have openly expressed themselves that they have no sympathy with such crimes as the one committed yesterday. At 8.30 o’clock, when this is written, no steps have yet been taken for an inquest beyond the notification of the coroner.
        The father of the little girl is away from home in an adjoining state where he is interested in a business venture. He is expected home today.

Coroner Beasley Holds Inquest Over Body of Boy Killed by Mob.


MOTHER DISOWNS NEGRO LYNCHED


Negroes of Town Refused to Allow His Burial in Their Cemetery, So That County Paid Expense of Interment Elsewhere.


        All is quiet at Honea Path, the scene of Tuesday night’s lynching, and there is not now the slightest indication that anything out of the ordinary has taken place there. Sheriff W.B. King and Coroner J. E. Beasley spent Wednesday at the scene, cut down the body of WIllis Jackson. The negro dealt with by the mob held an inquest and turned the body over to an undertaker to be prepared for burial which took place in the afternoon on the home place of Mr. Melvin Ashley at the expense of the county, the mother of the negro refusing to have anything to do with it.


Verdict at the Inquest.
        Some little trouble was experienced by the officers in securing 12 men to serve on the jury, but this was finally arranged, and after viewing the body, the jury repaired to the office of Magistrate Wilson, where the inquiry proceeded. There were possibly half a dozen witnesses examined, but nothing developed. It was impossible to learn the names of any who had witnessed the execution or had part in it, and a verdict in accordance to the facts was returned. That the deceased came to his death from gunshot wounds at the hands of an unknown mob.
        While a crowd of some 200 or 300 persons were assembled at the scene of the lynching earlier in the day, viewing the body of Jackson, a negro from the county passed in a wagon en route to the city for a load of lumber, an hand some words with Mr. Joe Ashley bearing on the blocking of the road way. An attempt was made by some to lay violent hands on the negro. [?] Sheriff W. B. King was present and prevented any trouble, sending the negro on his way, and seeming the promise of Mr. Ashley that he would make no move.


Mr. Ashley Not in It.
        Later, however, a crowd of some 50 men came upon the negro at the lumber mill, where his wagon was being loaded, and he was taken charge of and given in [?]. He was not badly hurt, however, and nothing further came of it. It was learned today that Mr. Ashley himself, had taken no part in handling the negro, as was stated Wednesday, having fulfilled his promise to Sheriff King that he would have nothing further to say to the negro.
        The trouble grew out of remarks made by the negro, Milt Mattison, to Mr. Ashley, concerning the blocking of the road. It is said the negro was disrespectful and used some profanity in the presence of several ladies who were in the car with mr. Ashley at the time.
        From Honea Path Wednesday, Sheriff King forwarded a brief report to Gov. Blease after the inquest over the body of Jackson, referring the governor to the newspaper accounts sent out with reference to the trouble and saying that so far as he had been able to learn at Honea Path, these were correct in every particular.
        The sheriff and Coroner Beasley had spent most of the day at Honea Path, arriving there at 9.30 and not returning until night.


Mother Disowns the Boy.
        When Jackson’s body was cut down from the telephone pole to which he had been hung, it was found that it had been riddled with bullets. The mother of the boy declared that she would have nothing to do with even a son, who would be guilty of such a crime, and the negroes of the town refused to allow the burial of the body in their burial ground.
        It was turned over to Undertaker Shirley, after the inquest, an order being given by the coroner and sheriff that interment be at the expense of the county on the place of Mr. Melvin Ashley. This was done during the day.
        In addition to being mutilated by bullets, it was found when the body had been taken down from the pole, that several fingers had been cut off during the night by members of the crowd and taken away as souvenirs. Parts of the clothing had also been cut away, and the rope too was cut up and the pieces carried away, after the body had been lowered.


Inquest a Brief One.
        But a brief time was required to hold the inquest. Everybody in the community was reticent regarding the hanging of the negro, and not one could be found who would admit that he was present, or knew anyone else who was on hand when the lynching occurred. There were half a dozen witnesses examined and little or nothing developed. It was learned at Honea Path by the officers that neither J.W. Ashley or his son, Mr. Joe Ashley, was with the mob when the negro was dealt with. They left the crowd at Honea Path, half a mile from the scene of the lynching, Mr. J.W. Ashley making a plea before hand that the law be allowed to take its course: that cooler heads be allowed to handle the matter, and that moderation be the guide of the party.
        Mayor Sullivan also addressed the citizens. He read a message from Gov. Blease asking that the law be allowed to take its course, and announcing that he would call a special term of court for the trial of the negro within two weeks. Mr. Sullivan pleaded with the mob, using every effort to prevent a lynching, but all was to, no avail: Jackson was taken immediately to the scene of his crime and executed.


No Prosecutions Expected.
        It is not expected that there will be any prosecutions in connection with the lynching. Sheriff King and Coroner Beasley were unable to get any evidence of any kind against any one at Honea Path, and this being the case, there can of course, be no steps taken looking to the handling of any one wh outlook part in the affair, as leaders or otherwise.
At Greenville Wednesday Solicitor P.A. Bonham said he thought it hardly probable that any legal action would be taken. If such were done, he said, however, that he would do all in his power to prosecute the cases, but that under conditions in the south, the outcome could easily be predicted.
With these conditions existing, there can be no steps taken looking to the arrest of
anyone in any way connected with the negro’s death. There is absolutely no evidence in the hands of the officers that would warrant a move of this kind. And so the matter rests.


A Word for Dr. Ashmore
        Sheriff W. B. King today requested the announcement that he had pressed, Dr. W. Frank Ashmore into service, ordering him to take the negro in his auto from the jail here to Greenville, and that the doctor had not acted in the matter of his own free will.
        “I have heard,” said the sheriff, “that Dr. Ashmore had been criticised by some for his part in the matter of spiriting the negro away from the jail here and I want the announcement made that he acted at my orders, that he did not volunteer his services.”
        The sheriff said that he thought any criticism of Dr. Ashmore most unjust. He [?], the sheriff said, under his (the sheriff’s) orders, aiding in an attempt to uphold the law, and at a moment when there was no time in which to make other arrangements to get the negro away, with the crowd after him only a short time out of the city.
        Dr. Ashmore should be commended, the sheriff says, rather than censured for the part he took in the matter.


No Doubt as to Identify.
        The Daily Mail today received the following from its Honea Path correspondent:
        Honea Path, Oct. 12. - In the yesterday’s issue of The Daily Mail there were some statements, concerning the identification of Willis Jackson, on the authority of two or three Anderson people who arrived at Honea Path before the mob reached there with the negro which do not tally with the facts. Contrary to the published statement, the family of the little girl gave the amplest and fullest opportunity for the identification of the negro by little girl. The writer was present when one of the suspects was taken before her, after Jackson had been carried to Anderson. She came to the back porch, was perfectly calm and quiet, looked at the negro carefully, and said with conviction that he was not the one. And when she was reminded that she ought to be very careful with her identification she looked at him again and said that he was not the one, but that the other one, referring to Jackson, was. When Willis Jackson was taken before her she was equally calm, and her identification was as positive after she had the amplest opportunity of seeing him. The writer has been assured that her identification just before the lynching was as posstive, accompanied by a revulsion of feeling for the one from who she had suffered so cruelly. More than this, her description of the boy as to size, [?], and clothing, enabled Constable Haynes to spot him at once. Again the boy worked in a local market and frequently delivered packages at her home. She had therefore the amplest opportunity of knowing him when she saw him and said before he was carried before her, not to the officer however, that her assailant was the boy who delivered meat from the supermarket. Contrary again to published statements the boy wore shoes, and his track was measured by one of the men who was first on the ground, and who saw him as he was suspended from the telegraph pole and then asserted that the shoe in size and shape tallied exactly with the track on the grounds. More than this it can be positively established on testimony of the whites and blacks that the boy Jackson was in the neighborhood before and after the crime was committed. It can be further established on the testimony of both races that this same negro had before this been seen in the same locally and that he seemed to be following and watching white girls who passed there. It is not the purpose of this writer to justify the lynching. He deplores it, and would have gone to any reasonable length to prevent it, but he is not willing for the community and those who already suffer deeply to be placed in a false light by careless statements based on rumors.


“Negro Assaults a White Girl; a Lynching Narrowly Averted” - The Anderson Daily Mail (Anderson, South Carolina), 10 October 1911 (third photo)
P. Robin


Crime Occurred at Honea Path Early This Morning and Victim Positively Identified Assailant.
EXCITING CHASE FOLLOWED
Negro Was Arrested and Brought to Anderson, and Soon Many Infuriated Citizens Came, Bent on a Lynching - Negro Then Rushed to Greenville in an Automobile, With Many Automobiles in Pursuit - Officers Elude Pursuers and Carry Prisoner on to Spartanburg.


Willis Jackson, colored, charged with criminal assault on the 12 year old daughter of a prominent citizen of Honea Path early today brought to the county jail here, and later taken by automobile to Greenville, is now en route to Spartanburg, having passed Greenville at 1.50 with several other automobiles. Indeed with members of an infuriated mob from Honea Path, only about 10 minutes behind, and every man of the mob determined to lynch the negro.
        Jackson was brought here about 9.30 o’clock by Honea Path officers, and placed in jail. He had been quietly arrested, identified by his victim and spirited away to jail here. In a short time a mob infuriated men were in pursuit, and the negro taken to Greenville. The mob pursued, gaining so much time en route that it was decided to take Jackson to Spartanburg, in an attempt to evade the mob.
        At Greenville the Anderson officers having the negro in charge, were joined by Sheriff Poole, and they are now en route to Spartanburg, with the mob only a short time behind. It is believed that if the officers with the negro are overtaken, there will be a lynching.
Much excitement has been created all along the route, by reason of the dastardly 
crime of the negro, and because of the effort being made by Hoena Path citizens to overtake and lynch him.


Story of the Crime.
        The 11-year-old, daughter of a well known former merchant of the town of Honea Path was criminally assaulted by a negro in a clump of woods near the home there today about 7.30 o’clock, and is in a critical condition as the result. A negro suspected of the crime was arrested there about 8 o’clock and hurried to jail there, it being feared that he would be lynched by a mob of [?] turned out en masse to search for him.
        The first arrest in the case was made a very short time after the crime had been committed. A description had been furnished by the victim, but this suspect was declared by her to be the wrong man, the second, Willis Jackson, she declared was the right man, and her description, given before hand, is against the negro in jail here, as he [?] this entirely, even to certain [?] in his clothing.
        As soon as the crime became generally known at Honea Path - but a very short time after it had been committed there was a general resumption of business, the stores being closed then the business people [?] aid in the search for the [?], and when Jackson had been identified as the man wanted, he was hurried here to prevent a lynching, the citizens having banded themselves together in a silent but determined body, bent on violence to the brute it captured.

        Just before 11 o’clock Clerk of ))) Jos. N. Pearnian had a long distance telephone message from Gov. Blease said that he would talk with Solicitor P. N. Bonham at Greenville with reference to ordering a special term of the court and since then nothing has been heard from him.
        The question was raised today as to whether or not the jurors drawn for the present term of the court of common pleas, and then ordered not to report, the jury cases being dispensed with could serve on a jury for the trial of Jackson, in case he is proven to be the guilty man. Several lawyers of the bar expressed the belief that this could not be alone: that another jury would have to be secured, and that the trial could not be held in a shorter time than ten days.


Story from Honea Path.
        Honea Path, Oct. 10: This town is greatly stirred. An awful crime has been committed here. The eleven year old child of one of our citizens was the victim of a criminal assault at the hands of a sixteen or seventeen year old boy. She had gone to carry this boy to the pasture, a quarter of a mile from home about 7.30 o’clock. She was on one of the main roads leading out of town and was seized and dragged into the woods about fifty yards where the attack was made, and it is feared that he accomplished his devilish purpose in the woods. In the woods there is every evidence of a fearful struggle. When the child was seized her assailant threatened to kill her if she cried out to give alarm. Terrified with fright she desisted from her cries. It is thought that the noise of a buggy approaching along the road may have frightened him and that he let his victim go. A gentleman from the country saw the negro come from the woods and seeing the child muddy and crying approached her. The news quickly spread. Willis Jackson was arrested on suspicion and taken before his victim, who positively identified him and as positively said that two other suspects were not the guilty party.
Constable Haynes look the negro in an automobile and hastened to Anderson and the boy Jackson is lodged in jail.
Several hundred men have gathered and they are grim, sullen and determined. If they
can in any way get hold of the negro they will make short work of him. They are all the more determined to violence because of the smallness of the victim; and because the governor in this community some weeks ago publicly approved of lynching under such circumstances. It is thought that a determined party of men will go to Anderson and if it is possible to assault the jail it is believed that they will do it.
        The little girl is calm and positive in her identification. She is considerably injured but is up and about the home and came to the piazza when one of the suspects was taken to her. Men are pouring in to town by all roads and excitement runs high. Calmer herds are doing all in their power to quiet the excited men and [?]
        Almost every man of the mob was heavily armed, [brang] shotguns, rifles, and pistols in the crows, with plenty of ammunition for every weapon.
        There was great disappointment here when it was found by members of the mob that they had been outwitted. Possibly a dozen machines, all [?] could be gotten, were filled [?] of the crowd, and [?] out in hot pursuit [?] who had he negro in [?], and there was no mistaking the determination that was written on the face of each man of the party to mean death to the negro.
        Here, however, there was some delay in getting away. Many on the machine that came from Honea Path had no claims on the [?] drizzling rain made it dangerous to the [?] of these [?] to take up the chase until the conditions could be remedied. Chains for some of the machines were [secured] in local garages, and they took to the chase, possibly half an hour behind the officers with the negro. There remained a real number of those who came here from Honea Path, after all who could get away, had taken up the chase. These having een unable to get [?]. There were some, however, who came up by train or trolley, who hired [?] here, and took up the race.


Jackson the Negro Wanted
It was said by a Honea Park [man], who came up with the crowd today, that there was now no doubt that Willis Jackson, the negro under arrest, is the guilty man. He was identified positively by the [girl] victim, he said, and his coat, smeared with [?] and bloody, was found at the meat market where he works.
        Jackson, according to this informant, was the third man arrested in a connection with the case, the other two having been released after being taken before the girl, she declaring that neither was her assailant. A fourth negro was arrested after the officers had started here with Jackson, but was later released.
        The victim of the negro is said to have declared before Jackson was arrested, that her assailant was the negro who brought meat to the house. And this was Jackson. She later identified him, and even described, before he had been arrested, the kind of clothes he wore, the description [?] exactly to Jackson, clothes and all.
        The assault occurred about 300 yards outside the city limits of the town of Honea Path. The girl had started to the pasture [with] a cow, when the negro came up behind, it is said, and placed his had over her mouth. She managed to throw off his hold and asked what he meant by such [?].
        It is said that the negro told her that if she would [?] loose the rope, by which the cow was being led, he would show her. She did so, and was then attacked. The child was then dragged by the negro into a clump of woods, where his fiendish purpose was accomplished, being left in a serious condition as the result.
        After the crime had been committed, it is said that Jackson returned to the market, where he worked, and where he was later arrested. He escaped the violence of the mob there because of the fact that the officers who brought him here, had already located him and made the arrest and get away while members of the mob were searching the strip of woods, where the crime was done, having been sent off on a false scent.


En Route to Spartanburg.
        A telephone message to The Daily Mail from Greenville at 2 o’clock this afternoon said that the car driven by Dr. Ashmore, and in which officers are in charge of the negro, Jackson, arrived there at 1.50, stopped for a moment at the jail, and left for Spartanburg. None of the cars containing members of the mob had then arrived. From Piedmont a message, just before that from Greenville, said that the car in which the negro was being spirited away, passed that point only about five minutes ahead of the first car of the mob, in which there were six or seven men. The other cars carrying members of the mob, the message said, were close on behind, and the opinion was expressed that the front car would be overtaken before it arrived at Greenville.
        Cars driven by members of the mob gained on Dr. Ashmore en route to Greenville, according to these messages, but it would seem from the message from Greenville, after that from Piedmont, that some of the time gained had later been lost.


Guard at the Jail Here.
        Before the arrival of the mob here about noon, officers of the law - deputy sheriffs and members of the police force - were armed with Winchester rifles and other weapons and placed at the county jail, but the plan to spirit the prisoner was later hit upon, and immediately put into position.
        No attempt was made by the mob to enter the jail. Every man of the crowd, determined through and seemed to be, was perfectly satisfied as to the truth of the statement that the negro had been taken to Greenville and immediately set about arranging to follow.


Negro Brought Here.
        Officers S.A. Haynes, accompanied by Messrs. G.E. Moore and M. J. Ashley rushed the negro here as soon as he had been taken before the victim of the horrible crime. They came in an automobile, arriving her about 9.30 o’clock and the negro was immediately placed in jail. At the time, it was said that a mob of citizens from Honea Path and the surrounding section were en route here bent on lynching the negro.
        According to information gathered from those who brought the negro here, the crime was committed in a grove between the home of the victim and the pasture, from which she was returning to the house, after having taken a cow there. She was attacked from behind, being knocked down by the negro, whom then accomplished his fiendish purpose.
        It was said by those who came here with the negro that the child was in a serious condition as the result of shook and bodily injury. Some of the Honea Path people who came to the city today, were of the belief that the wrong man had been arrested, and that the right one had evaded the officers and citizens, who turned out en masse to search for him.
        The first arrest in the case was made a very short time after the crime had been committed. A description had been furnished by the victim, but this suspect was declared by her to be the wrong man.
