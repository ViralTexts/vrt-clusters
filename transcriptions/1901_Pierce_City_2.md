REPUBLIC SPECIAL
Pierce City, Mo., Aug.19.--The ravishing and murder by a nergro of Girsia Wilde, a farmer's daughter, as she was on her way home form church Sunday has already led to two deaths at the hands of a mob of Pierce City's citizens, and the end is not yet.
The negro residence district is to-night patrolled by an armed body of men, who have sworn to purge Pierce City of negro criminals known to be in the neighborhood.
Officers are powerless in the face of these determined men, and it is morally certain that still another life will pay the forfeit for crime.
The least show of resistance as a unit by the negro population here would lead to a wholesale killing, so thoroughly worked up are the men who have taken it into their hands to avenge Miss Wilde's brutal murder.
From the moment Miss Wilde's body was discovered bying besides a lonely road with her throat cut from ear to ear and every evidence of assault present, there has been but one thought uppermost in the minds of Pierce City's citizens and the neighbors of the murdered and outraged girl's father--revenge. Bloodhounds were at once placed on the trail, and for hours a hundred men followed after them intent on only one purpose--vengance.
When the dogs were known to have failed these men did not give up. Right into the negro homes of Pierce City they went; demanded of every black that he tell aught he knew of Miss Wilde's death.
One man, Gene Carter, told conflicting stories, and while these were being investigated he was hurried off to jail, where another of his race, Will Godly, was already confined for other offenses.
The hunt for evidence continued all through the night and all of Monday. Carter did not kill Miss Wilde, but there was foundation for the belief that he could, if he would, tell a story which would eventually lead to the capture of the actual murderer. With this theory, the mob determined that he should be made to talk even if it took the shadow of a noose hanging over him to make him do so.
To-night both negroes were taken from jail by force, and Will Godly, who had served a sentence in State Penitentiary for committing assault on an old lady 60 years old, was hanged to the corner of the porch of the Lawrence Hotel and his body shot full of bullets. The other, Gene Carter, confessed that he knew who outraged and killed Miss Wilde and claimed it was a railroad porter, now on his run in Oklahoma.
Carter was then riddled with bullets and his body was left lying in the street. It is arranged that when the murder of Miss Wild arrives in Monett in the morning he will meet the fate of Goldy and Carter.

Miss Girsia Wilde, daughter of the farmer living two miles south of Pierce City, was ravished and her throat cut from ear to ear yesterday while returning from church. She was a beautiful young woman, weighing about 135 pounds. She evidently made a hard fight for her life, as her hair was torn, face scratched and her prayerbook, jewelry, etc., scattered in many directions.
