ILLINOIS CAPITAL RULED BY RIOTERS
Two Persons Killed, Many Injured, and Stores Wrecked After Lynching Is Foiled.
NEGRO QUARTER IS BURNED.
After Destroying White Restaurant Houses of Blacks Are Fired by the Crowd.


Riot, arson and slaughter held pos- session of the black belt and levee of Springfield, Ill., all through Friday night. Two men were killed, nearly 100 wounded, the streets were full of militia, and rioters set fire to negro houses in all parts of the black belt.
The fire department was intimidated and overawed by the rioters, and until the arrival of 1,000 additional State soldiers the authorities were practically helpless to control the situation.
Mob Balked by Ruse.
All this turmoil grows out of an at- tempt to lynch a negro who had at- tacked a white woman. The negro was spirited out of town, and the mob, balked in its vengeance, immediately turned on the man who loaned his auto- mobile to the authorities to enable them to convey the negro to a place of safe- ty. This was the spark that started the riot.
Special trains were hurried from De- eatur, Jacksonville, Bloomington, Pe-oria, and half a dozen other towns, bearing infantry, cavalry and artillery.
        Early in the state of riot all the sa- loons and disorderly houses in the city were closed by the Mayor, and the mili- tiamen did their best to prevent the col- lecting of any crowds in the streets. Their efforts were futile, however. They would disperse a crowd in one neigh- borhood, and it immediately reassem- bled in another.
        When at 2 a.m. the burning of negro houses commenced the negroes retail-ated by shooting from the upper stories of the houses in the neighborhood where the torch was applied. A number of persons were hit during these fusillades and were carried away by their friends before their identity was discovered.


Origin of the Trouble.
The inciting cause of the trouble was an assault made on Friday on Mrs. Earl Hallam, wife of a street car con- ductor. Mrs. Hallam, whose husband works at night, was pulled from her bed at midnight by a negro, who then -dragged her into a garden in the rear of the house, where he assaulted her.
This was the last straw on the minds of the whites of the city, the hatred against the blacks having been smolder- ing since a month ago, when Clergy A. Ballard was slain in his home by a negro, who, it is said, had entered the Ballard home in an attempt to assault Mr. Ballard's young daughter.
George Richardson, a negro, was ar- rested for the asasult upon Mrs. Hal- lam and placed in the city jail with Joseph James, who was accused of the Ballard murder.
Mutterings of mob violence began soon after the Richardson identification by the woman, and a great crowd col- lected about the jail. After Richard- son had been identified by Mrs. Hallam the crowds grew even more violent, and it was decided to take the prisoner out of town.
Sheriff Charles Werner made ar- rangements to take the men to Bloom- ington and the attention of the crowd around the jail was distracted by an alarm of fire while the men were placed in Harry T. Loper's automobile and whisked away to the railroad station near the fair grounds, where a train was stopped to let the sheriff's men and their prisoners get on board.
As soon as this was known the mob began to gather, howling for vengeance against the man who had assisted in the escape of their prey. The cry, "Come on to Loper's," was raised, and a few minutes later bricks were crash- ing through the windows. Loper met the mob with a rifle. They paid no heed to him, and he was forced into the back part of the building, where he was compelled to witness the complete de- struction of his property.


The restaurant was the largest in the city, and had a large trade. Within an hour it was a complete wreck. All of the furniture was taken out and piled on top of the automobile, which had been turned over on the street, and then a match was applied to the gaso- line tank. The bonfire raged until mid- night. The police were utterly power- less to cope with the mob and the fire department, which had been called out, was not allowed to extinguish the flames.
During the attack an attempt was made to do bodily harm to Mayor Reece.
At 10 o'clock Louis Johnson, a 19- year-old boy, was found dead in a rear stairway leading to the basement of a downtown building. He had been shot through the groin.
At the time the riot began Eugene W. Chafin, the Prohibition candidate for President, was addressing a meet- ing in the courthouse yard. A negro pursued by a mob came dashing up the platform, and in endeavoring to protect the man from his pursuers the orator was struck in the face with a brick and badly injured.
