CONSTITUTION AND BY-LAWS
OF THE
WHITE GOVERNMENT UNION.
1898.

EDWARDS & BROUGHTON. PRINTERS AND BINDERS, RALEIGH


PREFACE.
Our State is the only community in the world, with a majority of white voters, where the officers selected to administer the Government are the choice of negroes, and not of the whites.
This condition has been brought about by an unfortunate division among the white people; and it is likely to continue until that division is removed, and unity again prevails among them as it did prior to 1892.
The necessity for a closer union of the white people of the State is so apparent that it requires no argument, and that necessity has called forth the organization of THE WHITE GOVERNMENT UNION.


THE
WHITE GOVERNMENT UNION.
CONSTITUTION.

ARTICLE I.
The name of the organization shall be THE WHITE GOVERNMENT UNION.

ARTICLE II.
The purpose of the Organization shall be to re-establish in North Carolina the SUPREMACY of the WHITE RACE; to promote individual effort in behalf of the party and its candidates on the part of the voters, and to bring the head of the organization in the counties and State more closely and easily in touch with the Township Organizations, and the individual party voter.

ARTICLE III.
Neither Oaths, Grips, Signs, nor Passwords shall be allowed.
Any Union may, if it so desires, adopt a badge, button, insignia, or uniform.


ARTICLE IV.
The organization shall be divided into County Unions and Township Unions.


ARTICLE V.
Every WHITE MAN who desires WHITE GOVERNMENT in North Carolina, and is willing to use every practicable and honorable means to restore WHITE SUPREMACY therein, and who proposes to support candidates pledged to effect that purpose, in the ensuing election, shall be eligible to membership of the Township Union.


ARTICLE VI.
The County Union shall be composed exclusively of the chairmen of the several Township Unions, and the Chairman of the Democratic Executive Committee of the county, who shall preside over its meetings.
