THOMAS CILYARD WAS SWUNG FROM TELEPHONE POLE


Scenes Unparalleled in the History of Joplin Took Place Yes- terday Evening When Mob Law Reigned Supreme.


As announced in an extra edition of the News-Herald at 6 o'clock yesterday evening Thomas Gilyard, a/negro be- lieved to be the murderer of Policeman Theodore Leslie, was taken from the city jail by force and hanged to a tele- phone pole at the corner of Second and Wall streets.
Never, perhaps, in the history of Joplin were such scenes witnessed as those which accompanied the hanging of the negro Gilyard. All day yester- day excitement ran high and groups of men stood on every corner talking about the murder of Policeman Leslie. In every hamlet and village in the sur- rounding country the news was flash- ed from Joplin to watch for the mur- derer. In every locality for a radius. - of 25 miles men were scouring hill and dale, with set faces and stern pur- pose.
The wildest rumors came thick and fast stating that the murderer had been caught in this place or that and with each new report, still another band of armed citizens would start on double quick to investigate the story. It would seem that he whom the public sought could not possibly escape and as the day lengthened into the even- ing the tense nerves of the people never released. "He will, he must be found" seemed to be the universal ver- diet.


Just at 4:15 o'clock a shout went up from somewhere, nobody perhaps knew where. But that shout echoed far and wide. "They have the murderer" was the cry and from every street and al- ley, from every point and suburb, men and women and children came flocking to the jail.
On all sides, in front and even on top of the old structure a sea of surging humanity fought and struggled to get nearer the cell in which the shivering cowed black man lay.
Every moment swelled the crowd un- til thousands surrounded the prison and cries of "kill him," "Lynch the nigger" and "bring a rope"  arose on every hand.
"Break the jail down!" shouted fren- zied men and from somewhere came willing hands bringing a heavy timber. Only a moment did the crowd hesitate. Strong hands seized the battering ram, there was a crash and the side door of the old jail was in splinters. Into the corridor poured the raging, tossing mob, carrying down the cordon of po- lice who vainly sought to stem the ter- rible tide.


Down to the cell where Gilyard lay in an agony of fear, surged the mob. Someone raised a heavy sledge hammer aloft. Crash after crash came the ham- mer on the lock and louder yelled and stormed the wild crowd behind. As the blows fell the fastenings gave way, the door opened and into the cell like de- vouring wolves the avengers surged. Thomas Gilyard, from the floor where he lay, looked at those who came after him with a face from which hope had fled. 
Big and powerful as an ox, he was tossed about like a feather in the sea of humanity of which he was now the center. Out into the open air and bright sunlight Thomas Gilyard was dragged to his doom. Westward on Second street to Wall pushed the mul- titude and louder and still louder roar- ed the awful concourse which demand- ed the prisoner's life. The crowd was by this time swelled to thousands. Like a terrible vortex of raging billows the mob swayed and struggled and fought to reach the object of its wrath. A handful of bold, determined men fought manfully to save the negro in the interest of law and order. Back and forth, with the strength of desper- ation, these men struggled to hold the avengers back. Ravening hands seized the negro only to have their fingers torn loose from his quivering flesh. Long and faithfully those who wished the law to take its course battled with the mob and each moment the frenzy of the mob grew greater. Attorney Perl Decker was hoisted to the shoul- ders of the crowd and made a powerful plea in behalf of the law. Time and again was he pulled to the earth and each time he clambered back above the howling multitude, but his efforts were in vain.


Dr. F. E. Rohan struggled with might and main to hold the crowd in check and Mayor Cunningham was hurriedly driven to the scene in a buggy. Urging his horse as far as possible into the densely packed crowd, he stood up and commanded the attention of the crowd. But no human voice could make itself heard above that awful roar.
Louder and fiercer grew the cries for the negro's death. It now became a struggle for the mastery. Men fought like demons to reach the black man, who looked about him with staring, horror-stricken eyes.
Slowly but surely the negro and his would-be rescuers were borne across the street toward a telephone pole.
From somewhere a rope was whirled across the heads of the crowd. As its serpentine length flew through the air one end fell on the negro's shoulder.
Those who saw Thomas Gilyard's face at that moment will never forget the sight.
Somebody in the crowd cut the rope. 
"Kill the next man who does that!" roared many voices.
Around the doomed man's neck was placed the fatal noose.
"Oh, God, don't!" was all he said.
Clinging to the pole in mid-air were two determined men.
Silently they watched the scene be- low.
Each man was holding forth his hand.
Up came the loose end of the rope and the outstretched hands seized it. 
The crowd grew frantic.
"Up with him!" shrieked the crowd how beside itself.
Slowly the rope was torn from the hands of those who sought to prevent the lynching.
On Thomas Gilyard's face appeared a demoniacal grin.
The rope tightened.
Then up in the air the black, half nude body was drawn.
Up, up slowly, with dreadful delib- eration, the body rose.
An iron spike in the telephone pole gouged the side of the negro's head.
There was one convulsive movement of the negro's arm, as if he would seize the rope which closed about his throat.
High above the heads of the specta- tors the body hung, the features sul- len, the eyes closed, the heavy jaws set.
A life had paid the penalty for The- odcre Leslie's murder.
Thomas Gilyard was dead.


The Negro's Identity
Thomas Gilyard is the name of the negro who was lynched yesterday aft- ernoon. There is no doubting this fact, as the man would not likely give a fictitious name with death staring him in the face. He stated that he was 20 years of age and that his home had been in Murphysburg, Ill.
A News-Herald reporter was fortu- nate in securing a position near the darkey when the jail was entered. When the cell in which the man was confined was broken open, the prisoner was standing huddled in the darkest corner. It was with the greatest effort that he was dragged forth, as he clung like a leech to the iron walls. Al- though he resisted and struggled, he struck no blows. The negro was, how- ever, the recipient of many stunning blows as he was dragged from the cell, but after he had been carried into the alley, those who had their hands on the black wretch would not permit him to be assaulted.
As the prisoner was dragged from his cell into the jail he fell on his knees in an appeal to be allowed to say some- thing before he was killed.
"Gemmen," he groaned, "I know I's done wong, and I knows I's got to die, but lemme pray. Yes, for God's sake, lemme pray."
But the negro's words went unheeded and he was soon being dragged through a vast seething, excited mob of not less than 3,000 persons.
In front of the jail a temporary halt was made and several members of the mob shouted, "Did you kill Theodore Leslie?"
"Lor' God, gemmen," shouted the doomed man, "I didn't kill him. If you kill me you's killin' a innocent man." 
"Who killed him, then?" he was asked.
The negro rolled his great, blood- shot eyes and made no answer.
"Who killed him, then?" was again asked, and the negro replied:
"Gemmen, I doan know. Dah was three men there in de box car besides mahself."
"It's a lie! It's a lie!" howled the mob. "There were only two niggers there. One of them is in Carthage now. Get a rope!" And again the crowds surged forward. The negro was unable to walk, owing to the bullet wound in his left leg. All the way to the place where he was executed the wretch moaned and sobbed like a child and all the while he stoutly professed his innocence.
Just before the rope was fastened about his neck for the last time the negro groveled in the dust and uttered a prayer. His words were almost in- audible.
To a News-Herald reporter Gilyard said that he had done section work all his life. He stated that he was en route to Asbury to work on a section gang there when he got in trouble in the Kansas City Southern yards.
"What made you sneak away after you had been injured, if you were not guilty?" asked a member of the mob. 
"Well, gemmen," began the negro, "I-I-I"-
"Shut up! You're lying!" howled a score of men.
"No, gemmen; de reason I sneaked away was because I's afraid to come back to town. I didn't kill nobody, but I knowed I'd be taken foah de guilty man. Lor' God knows dat I am innocent. Gemmen, I's got a father an' a mother. Please, foah de lub o' massy, send foah my poor old mother before you kill me."
But the black fellow's appeals, al- though piteous in the extreme, fell on deaf ears.


The Story of the Capture
To Lee Fullerton, an employe of Bauer Bros. butcher shop, and to M. R. Bullock, who lives near Midway park, belongs the credit of Gilyard's capture.
Fullerton first discovered the man yesterday afternoon about 3 o'clock. He had gone to the company's slaugh- ter pen on Turkey creek between Mit- way park and the Frisco tracks and was just entering the yards when he saw a negro limping up the hill. The man carried a large gun and Fullerton thought at once that the man before him was probably the one who killed Officer Leslie.
"Where are you going?" he asked. The negro at first made no answer but finally, after sitting down and leaning against the fence, he replied, "Come here a minute, I want to tell you something."
"Tell me from where you are," said Fullerton.
"Well, boss, it's dis way. I got in a shootin' scrape in town last night and I got shot in de leg. I wants to stay here till I gets well."
At this stage of the proceedings Bul- lock appeared and the two men retreat- ed into the slaughter house near by. When they returned Fullerton carried a large butcher knife. To the negro he said, "I guess it will be all right for you to stay here," and Fullerton busied himself cutting tallow within a couple of feet of the negro.
Suddenly he leaped in front of the negro and placing the knife in front of the fellow's throat he said, "Make a movement and I'll cut your throat."
The negro was disarmed and then the two men took charge of their prisoner. 


Negroes Are Traveling
After the body of Gilyard had been cut down and removed to the morgue last night great crowds congregated about town and discussed the affair. There was considerable excitement and the streets were crowded with rapidly increasing throngs.
About 8 o'clock an uproar was heard on North Main street and as the crowds rushed to the middle of the street to ascertain the cause a huge body of men were seen approaching. On they came until it looked as if thousands must be in the multitude. "Out with the nig- gers" was the battle cry. South on Main until Seventh street was reached marched the throng, their numbers in- creasing every moment.
As the mob went east on Seventh street yelling and hooting, the negroes ran out of the alleys like rats in their fright and determination to get away. The firing of revolvers by the mob only accelerated the darkies in their efforts to get away.
The mob yelled:
"White folks, get in line."
"White folks keep your lights burn- ing."
"Negroes must move," etc.
Everywhere the cracking of glasses in negro houses could be heard and the rip, rip of boards as they were he- ing torn from negro shanties.
A quartette of young men sang beau- tifully a number of songs as they marched along the street. Their sing- ing was enthusiastically encored by the hundreds of people gathered to witness the mob's work.
When the mob had concluded its work on Seventh street the march was begun toward the north end. When the army reached this locality not a color- ed person was to be found. The evacu- ation was complete.
Then the work of destruction began. Windows were smashed in and doors. torn from their hinges. Finally the torch was applied and three houses were soon in flames. The fire depart- ment responded and when they had laid two lines of hose it was discovered that both strings had been punctured in many places, almost rendering the ap- paratus useless.
It is estimated today that over one hundred negro families will have moved out of the city by night. When a News-Herald reporter visited the lo- calities this morning scores of colored families were packing their belongings preparatory to taking the first train out of the city. Express wagons were driv- ing hither and thither hauling away furniture, boxes and all manner of household goods.


Autopsy Held
An autopsy was held over the re- mains of Thomas Gilyard at Fairview cemetery this morning. A coroner's jury witnessed the remains and the in- quest will be held in Deputy Coroner Potter's court room at 7 o'clock this evening.
Dr. Grantham performed the autop- sy and a small crowd of spectators wit nessed the gruesome task as the physi- çian probed and cut away the flesh from the bullet wound. The bullet entered the left leg just below the thigh and striking the hip bone, ranged upwards. A small piece of lead was found imbedded in the bone where the bullet first struck. From this point the course of the bullet was traced up- ward through the fleshy part of the leg to the base of the spine. At this point another small piece of lead was discovered and these were the only traces of the bullet found. Although the doctor made a thorough examina- tion of the body and cut a large part of the flesh away it was impossible to find the rest of the bullet. However, the fact that the bullet had been fired from beneath was plainly established. The hip bone where first the bullet struck was badly shattered and it is a mystery how the man ever managed to crawl as far as he did. Dr. Gran- tham is of the opinion that it would have been impossible for the negro to have evaded the clutches of the law for any length of time without medical attention.
The men on the jury are Howard Murphy, Bracken Wilson, Frank Felix, P. Harney, A. J. Baker and J. A. Thur- man.


Spirited Away at Night
Last night when the mobs were howl- ing about the streets the rumor became afloat that the body of the negro was to be secured and burned. The dead man all this while was in the morgue of the Joplin Undertaking company and Mr. Armington, fearing there would be violence, quietly spirited the body away. It was taken to the ceme- tery, where it was concealed in the woodshed of the sexton. At last, when the mob had been worked up to a fever heat of excitement, and after all arrangements had been made to raid the undertaking office and gain posses- sion of the corpse, the news spread that the body had been taken away. After this rumor had been substan- tiated, the crowds divided into groups and went in search of the body. Strangely enough no one thought of the cemetery and as a consequence the body remained unharmed.


Are Migrating
All day long there has been a marked migratory movement on the part of the colored poulation of the city. The re- port that there is to be a general clearing out of the negroes tonight has caused the larger part of the Jop- lin negroes to pack up or sell out and leave. It is said that the second-hand stores have done more purchasing of household articles today than they have during all the rest of the month. The negroes are thoroughly frightened. They firmly believe that something desperate is to be done tonight. Ru- mors come from Peirce City and Mo- nett that squads of citizens from those places are to join the local men in the work of cleaning out the town.


The Leslie Inquest
The inquest held before Deputy Cor- oner Potter last night on the death of Theodore Leslie, occupied but a very short time.
The following verdict was rendered: "We, the jury, after hearing the tes- timony at the inquest held over the body of T. C. Leslie, find that he. T. C. Leslie, came to his death by a pistol; shot from a 38-calibre pistol in the hands of a wounded negro, who was afterwards lynched, and whose name is to us unknown.
"C. W. LYON, "J. F. LEE,
"S. S. MEANOR,
"J. W. DOWNING,
"W. L. LAUDERBACK,
"G. W. LAVERY."


The witnesses who testified were Ike Clark, Frank McMullen, Cy Landis and Officers Rhubart and Belford. The re- mains were viewed, Tuesday night while lying in the morgue of the Joplin Undertaking company.
At 3 o'clock this afternoon scores of colored people could be seen wending their way along alleys and side streets carrying bundles of every conceivabie description.
All of the localities peopled by ne- groes presented a busy scene. Many of the colored people sold their personal effects for any price, others packed their belongings preparatory to ship- ping them and still others hauled their property away in wagons. The depot platforms were crowded with household goods and a number of the negroes have announced their inten- tion of going to Kansas City.
From appearances this afternoon it appears that the evacuation of the col- ored element in Joplin will be com- plete. A number of the negroes have stated that under no circumstances would they spend another night in Jop- lin. Reports of mobs which it is ru- mored might come to the city tonight have probably increased the uneasi- ness of the negroes, although it is not believed that any mob voilence will re- sult.
