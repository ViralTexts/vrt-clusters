From a special telegram to Mr. Isaiah Hardy, of the V. & M. Railroad, we learn some of the particulars of a fire that occurred at Meridian Saturday night. 
The fire was first discovered between the houses of Hulburt & Sons and Theodore Sturges & Co. ,on the corner of Lee Avenue and Front street. The entire part of the block fronting Front street was burned including the houses of Hulburg & Sons. Theodore Sturges & Co., Rosenbaum & Gully, W. A. Shimp, M.E. Cadwick, M. Boos, J.W. Harvey, John Hand and Dr. Broach Stock mostly destroyed. The loss is estimated at $75,000, insured for $28,000.
The fire was the work of incendiaries.--The citizens of Meridian were in council yesterday to repress outrages and incendiarism of negroes.
The following telegram from our special correspondent comes to us as we are writing:
Meridian, March 6, 1871.
Vicksburg Herald: A terrible tragedy occured in Meridian this afternoon. While the case of the State vs. Clopton, a negro charged with riotous conduct on Saturday night, was undergoing investigation, a difficulty occured in which Warren Tyler (negro) shot and killed Judge Bramlette, the presiding magistrate.
The excitement was intense and the melee became general. Tyler and two others negroes were killed. Several whites and blacks weae wounded.
The town is in arms, and the greates excitment prevails, though everything is now quiet. 
The difficulty is caused by the riotous conduct of the negroes on Saturday, and threats to burn the town.
In the fire on Saturday night, a whole square was burned and $75,000 worth of property destroyed.
Should anything further occur this evening, I will inform you.
