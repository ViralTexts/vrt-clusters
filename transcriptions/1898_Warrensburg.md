SCOURGED BY WHITECAPS.
Six Negro Women Whipped and Forced to Leave Home. 


Warnersburg, Mo., Aug. 3.-Six negro women were flogged and driven out of town by whitecaps Monday night. They were stripped to the waist and whipped with rawhides and were then taken to the railroad track and told to go.
Although the night was wet and dark they went cheerfully, preferring the darkness and exposure to further torture by the whitecaps.
The women were residents of "The Levee," a disorderly section of the town. Causes that led to the whipping were several robberies and assaults in that section at night. Although several per- sons were arrested in this connection it was impossible to convict them.
While many of the citizens of the city denounce the action of the whitecaps they admit that indications point to less law- lessness in the future.
After the whipping the women were weak and faint from the severe chastise- ment and fright, but they went gladly when told. The whitecaps went about their work in a calm and determined manner. Each man wore a white hood. Where they organized is not known, but they suddenly appeared at the homes of the women and without a word dragged them from their houses and tied them to telephone poles, where the whipping was done.
Their agonized shrieks were heard for several blocks, but although a lar number of citizens gathered, there was no attempt made to prevent the punish- ment. The women were marched up as far as the depot, where they were ilber- ated, only one man, who appeared to be the leader, speaking. His only word was "Go!"
After the women had gone the white- caps posted notices in several places in the district stating that they would call again. The result was an exodus of sev- eral of the colored residents yesterday.
