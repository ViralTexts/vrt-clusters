YET ANOTHER ASSAULT.
During the Investigation Into the Port Jervis Lynching a Man Tries to Assault a Girl.
By Associated Press.
PORT JERVIS, June 6-Great excite- ment was caused here today by the re- port of an attempted assault on the per- son of Lottie Kent, a child of nine years, by one John Damm, a painter. The assault occurred in an outhouse. The child screamed and attracted the mother's attention, who went to her daughter's rescue and saved the child. Damm is married and has several children, some of them fully grown. He is in custody. 
The coroner's investigation into the death of Robert Lewis on Thursday be- gan today at 2 P. M. in the corporation rooms. Dist.-Atty. Hirschburg con- ducted the examination until 4 o'clock, when it was handed over to C. E. Cudde- back and H. R. Fullerton of Port Jervis, who had been retained to aid the District Attorney in compliance with a request of Coroner Joseph Harding. The Dis- trict Attorney made a brief address in which he urged upon the jury the neces- sity of doing their duty fearlessly.
Simon S. Yaple, the policeman, was the first witness. His examination elicited information which doubtless will be acted upon by the grand jury. He testified that John Kinsela, a prominent Erie engineer, was in the mob about the jail, and that he had his hands upon the prisoner when he (Yaple) was trying to take him from the wagon. Kinsela, he claimed, was trying to resist him, instead of aiding him in protect- ing the prisoner. Another person whom he recognized was ex-Chief of Police McCombs but he was unable to say whether he was trying to help him or was working against him. Others whom the officer implicated were a men named Fitzgibbons, who he said kicked and struck the prisoner; Louis Avery, John Henley, James Kirby, Thomas Egan and Lorenzo Wood. He also testified that P. J. Collier, an undertaker and a special policeman, was in the mob and to the best of the officer's belief was trying to help the lynchers.
"I saw him trying to put the rope over the negro," said Yaple. "After the negro was dead I sent for an undertaker. Collier said he was an undertaker and would take him. I said, ‘You don’t want to take this man after hanging him, do you?’ Collier replied: ‘There will be $25 in it.’ “
The examination will be resumed to- morrow at 2 P. M.
Engineer John Kinsela, who was im- plicated by the testimony of Policeman Yaple, denies that he actively partici- pated in the lynching proceedings. He says that he saw the lynching from the sidewalk, but did not take part.
Important revelations are expected when Policeman William Boner goes on the witness stand tomorrow. It is rumored that the most decisive and con- vincing testimony against the lynchers. will not be produced at the inquest, but will be held in reserve to be used before the grand jury.
