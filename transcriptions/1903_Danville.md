ARREST FOURTEEN FOR RACE RIOTS.


Sheriff Whitlock at Danville, Ill. Had 30 More Warrants to Serve and Total May Be 100.


GRAND JURY WILL ACT.


Old Term Not Yet Concluded and Will BE Reassembled at ONce–Prisoners Face Penitentiary.


Danville, Ill., July 29.-[Special.]-Fourteen men charged with being members of the mob which assaulted the county jail Saturday night were arrested today by Sheriff Whit- lock and his deputies. Coincident with their arrest a special session of the grand jury has been called. The grand jury of the May term of court, which has not been concluded, will reconvene Monday afternoon to take up the riot in detail.
Warrants for at least thirty more men charged with participating in the riot, were sworn out today and placed in the hands of deputy sheriffs.
The arrests today are regarded as merely the beginning of the campaign to be made against the rioters by the authorities. Be- tween 75 and 100 warrants will be sworn out in all, and the authorities announce that they will make every effort to accumulate enough evidence to convict those who participated in the scenes of Saturday night. The next few days are expected to witness arrests by the wholesale.


Troops Still on Guard.
Two companies of the Seventh regiment are still in the city and will remain here for sev- eral days. The troops are still encamped op- posite the jall and the picket lines are out.
Sheriff Whitlock today summoned to the city all of the deputy sheriffs in various parts of the county. They have all arrived and will not only assist the sheriff in arresting rioters but will also swell the numbers of the defenders of the jail. Sheriff Whitlock's force of deputies now in the city numbers twenty-five, a sufficient force, it is thought, to successfully defend the jail even if the troops leave. The arrests have caused much comment, but there seems to be no danger of any uprising on the part of the friends of the imprisoned men, and, while guarding against any possible contingency, the author- ities expect no trouble.
An inquest over the body of Henry Gatter- man, whose murder by the negro Metcalf precipitated the riot, was held tonight. The verdict was that he came to his death through wounds inflicted by Metcalf.


Names of Men Arrested.
The men who have been arrested are: 
Bicknell, Harry, miner, Danville,
Cundiff, Sherman, farmer, of Tilton. 
Davis, Cicero, miner, Misaelonfield. 
Dell, Thomas, miner, Danville. 
Devore, Charles, miner, Danville.
Hart, Ed, miner, Missionfield. 
Merry, Adam, miner, Westvilla. 
Mobaker, Clement, miner, Danville. 
Pettis. William, laborer, Hillary. 
Rennick, Henry, miner, Catlin. 
Roberts, Dick, walter, Danville.
Slade, Newton.-, Vermilion Heights.
Van Gundy, Harry, electrician, Danville. 
Walton, John, miner, Danville.
The men were arraigned before different justices of the peace and their hearings were continued to Aug. 6. The bonds were fixed at $500 each and only two, Cundiff and Van Gundy, were able to furnish them. The others are imprisoned in the jall they are accused of having assailed Saturday night.
The charge upon which the men are arrest- ed is that of defacing a public jail. The penalty for this, when the damage done ex- ceeds $15, is not less than one nor more than ten years' sentence. As the damage in this case is far above the amount named, every man arrested faces a possible penitentiary of sentence.
Harry Williams, a laborer living in this city, was arrested charged with assault with a deadly weapon, but was later released, an examination showing him to be innocent. He was supposed to have been one of the men who stoned Sheriff Whilock on the night of the riot.


Only Three of Wounded Arrested.
Three of the men arrested, Merry, Hart, and Slade, are among those wounded in the assault on the jall. None of the other wound- ed men have been arrested as yet, but will be soon. The arrest of Van Gundy caused some surprise, as he has resided here for a number of years and has the reputation of being an excellent citizen. It is stated, how- ever, he was seen in the foremost ranks of the mob at the jall by both Sheriff Whitlock and State's Attorney Keeslar, who tried in vain to persuade him to go home. Cundiff is a well known farmer, who has also enjoyed a good reputation.
Says Law Will Be Vindicated.
Springfield, Ill., July 29.-Attorney General Hamlin this evening stated that he believes there will be a vindication of the law at Danville, and that the officers will make a conscientious effort to convict the leaders of the mob, Mr. Hamlin is daily in com- munication with States Attorney Keeslar and Sheriff Whitlock and has offered all the means of his office to assist in bringing the rioters to justice. He says action must be taken before the rioters have a chance to get together and unify their influences to prevent prosecutions.
Yates Fears More Trouble.
Gov. Richard Yates will attend to the duties of his office tomorrow for the first time in forty days. The executive came home to night from Jacksonville, where he spent the day with his mother, Mrs. Katherine Yates. To interviewers he said it is too soon since his return to talk politics, and he had not been fully informed about the Danville lynch- ing. It is understood that Gov. Yates is opposed to taking the troops away from Danville at once because of the information that serious trouble is likely to result there next Saturday night, when the workmen about he mines in Vermilion county will as- semble in the town again for the first time since the rioting. The executive praises the bravery of Sheriff Whitlock in keeping the mob at bay and preventing additional lynch- ings.
