FIFTY-SEVEN KILLED, 300 WOUNDED, TULSA RACE RIOT
MORE THAN HUNDRED WOUNDED IN TERRIFIC BATTLE THROUGHOUT CITY; BLACKS DRIVEN FROM ENTRENCHMENTS BY MACHINE GUN FIRE
Tulsa, June 1.-(United Press)-Seven whites and fifty negroes are dead and thirty-two whites and two hundred negroes are wounded as the result of terrific fighting and rioting, according to the best information from hospital and police sources.
Under cover fighting continued on Davis Hill on the outskirts of the city. This hill later developed into a stronghold for the negroes, who en- trenched themselves but were routedby machine gun fire. Additional guardsmen arrived in West Tulsa. All the whites have been deputized.
Five hundred negroes are reported to have left Muskogee for Tulsa, and whites are leaving here in autos to meet them. The negroes were trans- ferred under guards from Convention Hall to McNulty Park. Fire, which has consumed the negro section, is consuming parts of the white resident-ial section in the eastern part of the city.
Tulsa, June 1.-(United Press)-The fire was under control by the fire department this afternoon. The authorities also had the riot situation handled at noon and no more conflicts were expected. Three hundred and fifty guardsmen are on the scene and others are enroute. It is estimated that 2,000 armed whites, negroes and police and guardsmen participated in the night's battle.
Tulsa, June 1.-(United Press.)- Rioting between whites and blacks in the negro section of this city con- tinued today with the sound of fir- ing coming from that quarter of the city. Parts of the battle area were set fire and were burning furiously at 8:30 this morning.
Scores were reported injured by rifle fire and the number of killed was not known at 9 this morning. The whites formed a circle around- the negro section and captured hun- dreds of negroes. At 8:30 white civ- ilians, co-operating with the police and guardsmen in quelling the riots, had marshalled approximately 3,000 negroes, herded them up North Main street to the Convention Hall, where, the blacks were held under guards.
Twenty-six long lines of negroes, eight and ten abreast, were marched up the streets by the whites at 8:15 with their hands in the air, while the whites held rifles against their ribs.
Thousands of negroes fled from the city along the railroad right of ways. Airplanos loaded with nitro- glycerine bombs, circled over the ne- gro section, and blacks taking cover in their shacks, kept up an incessant howling as the airplanes circled.
Three National Guard units were on the scene when the trouble start- ed last night, and Adjutant General Barrett, arrived today to take per- sonal charge of the situation. At 8:15 this morning, when the fight- ing was reported to have died down in the negro section, a white man dashed up to Convention Hall and called for help, saying that fighting had broken out at McNulty Park. Heavily guarded negro men and wo- men, with rifles held at their ribs, continued to be brought to Conven- tion Hall all morning in autos and on foot. 
Every business house in Tulsa closed today to help the authorities cope with the situation. Negro work- ers in restaurants and stores were dragged out and coralled at Conven- tion hall. The rioting startel last night when a mob of armed whites gathered around the jail to get Dick Rowland, charged with assaulting a white girl. Armed negroes also gathered at the jail to prevent the taking of Rowland, the fighting be- ginning at 10 last night. 
How Trouble Started. 
The trouble is believed to have started when a negro was arrested late today for an alleged attack on a white girl. About 7 o'clock auto- mobiles filled with armed negroes appeared on the principal streets, headed for the county court house. The jail in which the negro was con- fined is located on the upper story of the courthouse.
Shortly after the jail had been sur- rounded by a mob of approximately 200 negroes, several armed white men appeared. The news seemed to spread rapidly, and before the light of day had completely faded, the streets were lined with curious mobs, and the streets with serious faced men, both white and black, most of them armed.
When Firing Began.
The first firing came shortly after dark when a negro was stopped by an officer and his gun taken away. He attempted to resist, according to the officer, and was shot dead. Three hours later his body was picked from the street and taken to police head- quarters which is being used for a temporary morgue.
The first white man was killed in fighting at the court house before the guardsmen arrived. The second was killed, according to police, when a party of whites passing in a motor car, mistook him for a negro and shot him. He died almost instantly.


Governor Cailed
A call for Gov. J. B. A. Robertson was put in about 11 o'clock and not a half hour later Adjutant General Barrett had ordered national guard troops at Muskogee, Oklahoma City and Wagoner, held in readiness and had ordered three Tulsa units onto the streets. This morning the units were formed in a circle about the lines.
The mobs about the courthouse were broken up without firing from the guards, it was announced. but scattered firing was still heard in several sections this morning.
Muskogee Blacks Want in. 
Muskogee, June 1.-Police this morning were guarding all roads leading from Muskogee to prevent the leaving of armed negroes for Tulsa, after having been warned that a movement had been started here among the negroes to join forces with the rioters at Tulsa.
