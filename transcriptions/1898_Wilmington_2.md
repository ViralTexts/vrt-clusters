November 11, 1898, “MOB LAW RULES A CITY..” The Sun (New York City)
J. Romero
        Wilmington, N. C. Nov. 10. -This has been a turbulent day in Wilmington. Race war and revolution have held carnival. Early this morning a body of fully 1,000 representative white men destroyed the office, building, and plant of the negro daily newspaperm. the Record, and would have lynched the editor had he not previously left the city. A few hours later a fight arose between white guards by whom every block inhabited by white people was being patrolled, and a mob of several hundred negroes. Pandemonium reigned. Six negroes were killed and twenty wounded. The Mayor, S. P. Wright, Chief of Police J. C. Melton and the Board of Alderman, a fusion-negro régime, became terrorized and resigned. Under the direction of a Citizens’ Committee successors were elected, so that now ex-Congressmen A. M. Waddell is Mayor. Edgar C. Parmalee Chief of Police, and a new Board of Aldermen has assumed the reins of government. 
        Peace and order have been restored, and five hundred special policemen many mounted and on bicycles are patrolling the streets. About five hundred armed citizens and militia from Fayetteville, Kingston, Goldsboro and else-where are here to help maintain order. The committee of twenty-five representing the massmeeting of white citizens in the execution of the provisions of the resolutions adopted yesterday, demanding the departure of Editor Mainly from the city and the removal of the Record plant, were to have received a definite answer to their demands from representative negroes at 7 A. M, to-day. Chairman A. M. Wadell was to report in front of the Wilmington Light Infantry armory at 8 o’clock. At the appointed hour more than five hundred determined white citizens, merchants, lawyers, preachers, doctors, well armed with guns and revolvers, gathered at the armory. And Col. Waddell reported that he had received no answer from the negroes. They waited at the armory until almost 9 o’clock hoping that an answer complying with their demands would be received, but none came. 
        The men formed in line, four abreast, and started on the march to the Record office, in a thickly populated negro settlement. As the long column of armed men approached the neighborhood a throng of negroes, men women, and children, began to flee in frenzy. Very soon scarcely one was in sight anywhere. When the column reached the building, a two-story frame structure, the men were halted, and several advanced to the door. It was locked. 
        A few blows by stalwart men forced it open, and about twenty citizens entered, and within a few minutes the whole plant was wrecked and the broken pieces pitched into the street. The windows of the house were broken out. As the numerous fragments were tossed into the street and the people recognized what they were exultant shouts wnet up. It was a long sign, “The Record Publication Company,” was cast into the stree that the greatest outburst of cheers went up. A beaver hat was thrown out and quickly torn in pieces, as was a life bust cray on likeness of Editor Manly. 
BUILDING SET ON FIRE. 
        When the wrecking was about complete, it became evident that the building was on fire. Smoke was pouring out of the upper windows. There were shouts of indignation and commands to extinguish the flames, but the fire spread quickly, so that the Fire Department had to be called out. As the engines and hose reels dashed up several rounds of shot were fired by the men who were lined up for more than two squares either way. The department quickly had the fire under control, but not before the building was a total wreck. The spread of the flames to adjacent buildings was prevented. 
        Conservative men very much regret the fire, not only because it was entirely unneccesarry, but endangered a great deal of other property as well. Close on one side of the building was St. Stephen’s Church, the largest and handsomest negro church in the city. On the other side with only three or four small cottages joined close together, between it and the burning buildings is Ruth Hall, a large and well equipped hall, and used by negroes. Not one of the adjacent buildings was injured. 
        As soon it was apparent that the fire was under control the people left the scene and dispersed through the city, many of them going on guard duty on the various blocks. All was quiet until wild rumors, with no foundation in fact, were carried of the negroes. More than 500 were at work in the cotton compress. They were told that their homes were being burned. They rushed pell-mell from their work. However, by the efforts of Messrs. James and W. H. Sprunt, the proprietors of the Alexander Sprunt & Co. plant. the great majority were stopped and finally controlled. They left for their homes in small squads. 
SHOOTING BEGINS.
        About the time the negroes were calmed news came from the First ward over the railroad that a riot was in progress there. Large numbers of white men boarded the street cars or went on foot to the scene, corner Fourth and Harnett streets.
        This was about 11:30 o’clock. When they reached the scene six negroes had already been killed and fully twenty wounded. One young white man, William Mayo, was wounded seriously, and wo others, George Piner and a Mr. Chadwick, were slightly wounded. 
        What gave rise to the trouble was that white guards who were on duty on the corner of Fourth and Harnett streets halted a number of negroes who showed a threatening manner. All of them save one heeded the advice of the guards to go away. He finally turned as though to move away, and he suddenly wheeled about and fired at the guards. Very quickly several rifle balls crashed through his body, killling him instantly. The ball fired by the negro took effect in William Piner’s arm, Negroes in sight quickly darted around corners, and in a few minutes one of them rose’up from behind a fence and fired a rifle seriously wounding William Mayo, now of Yonkers, N. Y.. who was standing on the plazza of his father’s residence. Mr. Mayo was here to vote and would have returned home in a few days. The negro was captured. He was in his own yard. Two rifles were found in his house. 
        A large mob of negroes assembled about a square away and reinforcements for the white men having arrived, a volley was fired upon them killing four and wounding others. The negroes quickly retreated.
        The Wilmington Light Infantry and the naval reserves were called out, and the rapid-fire gun and Hotchkiss one pounder were also hurried to the scene. A mob of several hundred negroes was gathered on Ninth street, corner of Nixon, but as the military advanced the negroes fell back and scattered,
        When near Sixth and Nixon a shot was fired into naval reserves from a negro house. A volley of bullets was fired by the military through doors and windows, killing one negro. Six more inmates were camptured and escored to jail. The house was demolished. 
        With the exception of two or three casualties in remote parts of the city, this ended the rioting scenes of the day.
        The news of the conflict spread quickly to neighboring cities, and large bodies of men arrived during the afternoon from Fayetville and near-by towns. All parts of the city inhabited by white people are guarded closely tonight.
        It is learned to-night that the negro who shot Mayo was found secreted in the house. He was taken out and told to run for his life. He started off, but only advanced a few yards before his body was riddled with bullets.
        A negro named Tom Miller, and a white man, both of whom had taken a prominent part in inciting the negroes to riot, were sought for and placed in jail. Five other negroes were also incarcerrated, and several banished from the city. 
        The negro policemen who are attached to the “force” under the old regime failed to report for duty to-night.
        A white Republican who has been an energetic negro leader had peremptory noties to leave the city, which he did after promising never to return. A large numer of firearms were captured to-day from the negroes.


November 27, 1898, “Race Riots and Shotgun Law in the Carolinas” (The San Francisco call.)
J. Romero


Race Riots and Shotgun Law in the Carolinas
Wilmington. N. C. Nov. 19. - The Governor of South Carolina, he says to the Governor of North Carolina, “It’s along time between lunchings”: and the Governor of North Carolina he says to the Governor of South Carolina, “Sh-h! Don’t talk to me about lynchigs. Golly! Don’t you know they came near lynching me the other night?” 
        Thus in allegory they are telling through this Southern country of an incident in the race war of last week which somehow did not get into the papers, but came very near furnishing as big a sensation as North Carolina ever had in its history. So far as recalled no Governor of a State in this country has ever lost his life at the hands of indignant citizens of his commonwealth.
        But Governor Daniel L. Russell of North Carolina came very near suffering it from mob rule when the excitement was at its height and while the streets of Wilmington were literally running with blood. 
        Governor Russell began his political career as a leader in this section of the State. He organized the colored Republicans in Wilimington and more than any other one man is responsible for the ascendency of the African over the white man in the Cape Fear region. So when the negroes were shooting at the white citizens and the white citizens were actually potting the negroes by dozens with Winchesters, Springfields and shotguns, the Governor, who was in this section of North Carolina, hearing of the trouble, started for home. 
        “LYNCH THE GOVERNOR.”
        He first intended going by way of Goldsboro. Learning that there was a mob of several hundred men at Goldsboro waiting to give him a reception, and knowing that at that period of excitement he was a marked man, he changed his route and went via Maxton. Word got to Maxton ahead of the Governor that he was going that way, and when the train arrived a swearing, howling mob of “red shirts,” heavily armed and ready for almost anything, was awaiting him.
        They invaded the car, threatened the Governor and actually offered him violence. The crowd was increasing and there were cries of “Lynch him!” when the Governor and one of his friends hustled out of the car into a box car, which was locked behind him, and the conductor and his friends stood guard until the train pulled out.
        Governor Russell reached his home, in Raleigh, over the Seaboard Air Line, very badly frightened, and the Governor’s friend did not have a button on his coat and his raiment was in tatters. The Governor weighs more than 300 pounds and his frustrated enemies at Maxton are still speculating as to the figure he would have cut at the end of a rope. 
        This is only one incident of the many exciting events that have stirred the two Carolinas during the last ten days. 
        There has been a great political riot and a wholesale massacre of negroes in Wilmington, N. C. There has been a great political riot and a wholesale massacre of negroes in Greenwood, S. C. The story of Wilmington and the story of Greenwood both furnish food for thought, but on far different lines. 
        THE WILMINGTON RIOT.
        At Wilmington at least fifteen negroes were killed, but no white man lost his life. At Greenwood at least eight negroes were kileld and one white man lost his life. 
        I will first tell the story of Wilmington and then of Greenwood, and let the impartial reader draw his own conclusions and make his own comparisons. 
        The Wilmington riot was due entirely to the negro attaining supremacy in local politics. North Carolina is about the only Southern State in which the negro has practically without restriction exercised the right of suffrage. The negroes have been permitted to do this because they were in the minority. There are 210,000 white voters in the State and only about 100,000 colored voters. Only in recent years did the danger of the negro securing supremacy become threatening. In 1898, when a combination of the black and white Republicans and the Populists made Russell Governor by an enormous majority, the white voters, and especially the Democratic white voters, began to have their apprehensions. 
        Governor Russell hails from the section of the State in which Wilmington is situated. Here the ratio of colored men to white is almost two to one. The Governor and his Republican allies got hold of the government of the city of Wilmington, and in order to keep the negroes solid permitted them to share in the offices. The colored men here quickly felt their power. They realized that it was through their votes that the Republicans had triumphed. While the Republican leaders held the more important offices the white men in Wilmington soon found that they had over them a colored police force, white the fire department largely consisted of colored men and the last post office was manned with colored letter-carriers. 
A NEGRO GOVERNMENT.
        In fact, to all intents and purposes, it was a colored city government. The colored city government levied the city taxes, collected them and spent them. The whites were paying 96 ½ per cent of the taxes, the colored were paying 3 ½ per cent of the taxes.
        Following the induction into office of this new regime came a repetition of the old story of profligacy and an abuse of power. Nearly every Southern city in the days of reconstruction had been through it, and now it was Wilmington’s turn. The colored men did not make good policemen. They neglected their posts and robberies multiplied. Women were insulted on the street and there was no redress. White women could be jostled from the sidewalks into the muddy streets by colored women and negro men would laugh at them. Little white girls would have their hats snatched and thrown into the roadway and assaults of negroes upon whites were of constant occurrence. Property was insecure and insurance rates advanced. 
        Even Mr. Chadbourn, the Republican Postmaster, wrote and published a letter, in which he declared that the negroes were in charge of the municipal government of Wilmington; that the whites would not longer fear with this condition of affairs, and that “they would carry the next election either with votes or with arms.”
        Long before the canvass in the campaign just closed began the white citizens of Wilmington, almost without regard to party, prepared for the greatest emergency. Six months ago they began to arm themselves quietly. Each white citizen not affiliated with the Republican reign, if he did not already have a serviceable firearm, purchased a Winchester or a Springfield rifle, and lots of ammunition. They determined to carry the fall election by force and intimidation if they could not carry it any other way. 
GOVERNOR RUSSELL ALARMED.
        They made no concealment of this determination before the election; they make no concealment of it now. They were firmly convinced that the African was not born to rule the white man, and no amount of argument can change their opinion.
        Governor Russell became alarmed at the threatening condition of affairs that his management had brought about. He was notified that something dreadful would happen in Wilmington if the negroes attempted to outvote the whites on election day, and through his influence the Republican leaders were forced, just before the election, to take down their ticket and give the Democrats no opposition in the county except one Representative in Congress and State Senator, these districts including other counties than New Hanover, in which Wilmington is situated. 
        Election day passed off quietly in Wilmington, although in three or four other counties in the State the negroes were intimidated an hindered from voting by the presence of armed men at the polls. 
        The election being over the whites determined to put out of office the entire city government, by force if necessary. The Governor tried to induce the city officials to resign, but without avail. Then an orderly meeting of the white citizens was called, and resolutions of the city government in the interest of the white population, calling on Alexander Manly, the colored editor of the Republican paper, to leave town, and appointing a committee to wait on the more objectionable white officeholders and colored leaders and invite them to leave the county. 
        WHITE MAN KILLED FIRST. 
        The story of the exciting events that followed this revolution have already been told. Manly, the colored editor, who had been an object of loathing for months because of the editorial attacking white women, had already taken his departure. The Record office was burned, because the proprietors of the paper were believed by the committee appointed at the mass meeting to be ignoring its demand. 
        An outbreak on the part of the negroes had been expected that day, and nearly every white man in the city of Wilmington was under arms. This has been estimated at 2000. The white citizens of each block had a distinct organization under a separate leader. Each man had his orders, and no matter where disorder broke out the white citizens were prepared to quell it quickly or add to it materially. 
        There is no question that the first shooting was done by the black men. A negro in Brooklyn, a suburb, shot a white man through the right arm. The wounded man with his left hand shot the negro dead. The negroes began to rally in force with guns, and four of them were shot dead in their tracks then and there. The blacks were overawed, but not before at least fifteen had been killed and probably twice as many wounded. One negro was founded badly wounded hiding beneath a porch and was taken to a hospital. 
        It was reign of terror simply for the blacks and their white associates. 
        A REIGN OF TERROR
        A committee moved quickly around and notified the more prominent and objectionable white Republicans that they must leave town. Silas P. Wright, the Mayor, had already gone. Justice of the Peace Bunting, who was also United States Comissioner, was told to go. So were Chief of Police Melton and Charles Gilbert, the superintendent of city carts. Notice was also served on G. Z. French. Mr. French is the acting sheriff. He allowed the actual Sheriff $1200 salary, and performed all the duties of the office himself and took all the emoluments. 
        Pictures of Bunting and his colored housekeeper still hang on a tree infront of his house, where they were hung by the mob. Thomas Miller, a noted colored leader, who, when he heard the Record building had been burned, declare that he would wash his hands in white man’s blood that night, was lodged in jail, and a picket was thrown around to prevent the more irresponsible whites from dragging him forth and killing him. 
        Colonel Waddell, one of the most prominent citizens, who had been chairman of the mass meeting, was elected Mayor, and all the old officials resigned under pressure. Waddell has a fighter’s jaw. His ancestors have fought in three wars. 
        Dr. Silas P. Wright offered his resignation as Mayor of the city, and it was accepted. Colonel A. M. Waddell was elected Mayor of the city and sworn in by M. W. Newman. J. P., whereupon Mr. Waddell took his seat as Mayor. 
        Nearly all of the old city officials are now in Washington seeking to have a Congressional investigation or are wandering northward seeking new places of abode. 
        The statement telegraphed North that ministers of the Gospel, with rifles on their shoulders, paraded the streets on Thursday and Friday nights to preserve order is no fiction. This actually took place. It is also a fact that the race question in Wilmington rose above politics, and that many white men heretofore Republicans joined in overturning the city government. 
        The fury of the mob at Wilmington when it finally burst forth was added to by race prejudice, long kept in restraint in North Carolina. The deepest blot on the city is that the poor whites wantonly shot any negroes they met. Most of the murdered victims were unarmed and molesting no one. 
        So high did the feeling in Wilmington run during the political campaign that it is a marvel that there was not a murderous outbreak long before Thursday, November 10. 
        Early in the campaign Governor Russell became a target for the orators of the white man’s party. The Governor owns a large plantation on the other side of Cape Fear River, just opposite Wilmington. For years he has supplied the city with milk. Some one printed a communication in the Messenger one day inquiring why white men brought Governor Russell’s milk, since he was responsible for negro rule in the city. 
        Instantly the Governor’s dairy was boycotted and his milk is not now sold in the city. 
        So much for the story of the riot in Wilmington. Now for the story of Greenwood. 




December 27, 1898, “A POLITICAL DEAL,” The Semi-Weekly Messenger (Wilmington, North Carolina)
J. Romero
A POLITICAL DEAL
Eward to Walk the Plank-Pritehard to be Shelved with a Judeship-Leak to Serve as Senator for a Little While. The Wilmington Riot Matter
        A special to the Raleigh Post of yesterday from Washington says:
        Ever since Governor Russell’s visit here there have been rumors current in the inner North Carolina circle that a deal is on foot whereby Ewart is to be defeated in the senate for judge of the western district, Senator Pritchard to be appointed in his place and V.S. Lusk to be named as senator by Governor Russell to succeed Pritchard. This same rumor was current last winter, but proved to be at that time unfounded. It appears now with a semblance of substance at least to it, but whether it is well founded future developments alone can determine.
        It is certain now that Governor Russell is opposed to the confirmation of Judge Ewart. He covered his tracks so well while here that at first he was believed to have interested himself in Ewart’s behalf. Senator Pritchard was led to so believe, but after the governor’s departure, he became possessed of information to the contrary. Senator Pritchard still favors Ewart, but the best legal minds in the senate are opposed to him and Senator Butler will leave no stone unturned to defeat him. It is well known here that Pritchard would not decline a life position such as is the place of judge of the western district of North Carolina.At the same time. Pritchard does not wish to be placed in a position of being even by inference, opposed to Ewart, and he frowns upon all suggestions in that direction. Yet if Ewart if defeated Pritchard’s is the name that is likely to occur to the president as an acceptable one. It is said that Governor Russell suggested him to the president. 
        Then too Pritchard would meet with almost instant confirmation. Senatorial courtesy alone would insure that. It is also pointed out that in the next senate, with a heavy republican majority, Pritchard’s vote would not be needed by the republicans. Butler would not oppose Pritchard. In fact they have of late been getting closer together than heretofore. Pritchard’s days, democrats assert are numbered in North Carolina, and beyond his present term as senator he would have no political future. As judge he would have a life position. Then too, it is said that Butler would angle for Pritchard’s help, in consideration of Butler’s allowing Pritchard’s confirmation. This would leave the road clear for Russell to reward Mr. Lusk, a friend of Pritchard as well as himself, by appointing him senator. All this suggests the formation of a Pritchard-Butler-Russell combine, and the ground indications, at present, look that way.
ALL LOOKS TO SIMMONS.
        Among democrats here no other name is heard as the next senator from North Carolina except that of Chairman Simmons. His record while in congress was excellent, and among the older members, both of the house and the senate, he is remembered most pleasantly. It is not believed among democrats that any combination can be found among the populist-republicans that can prevent the democrats from controlling the next legislature.
WILMINGTON RIOT CASES.
        The department of justice does not seem to be concerning itself much over the Wilmington riot cases. The direct prosecution of these cases has been placed in the hands of District Attorney Bernard. Regarding the detail of witnesses summoned before the grand jury, etc., the department of justice professes ignorance. 
        “The presumption is that officials will do their duty, is it not?” suggested The Post correspondent to Assistant Attorney General Boyd, referring to the failure of Mr Bernard to have essential witnesses before the Raleigh grand jury. 
        “That is the presumption,” he said, “but sometimes it is a violent one.
Mr. Boyd said that so far as he knew no letter from Judge Purnell, “tart or otherwise,” regarding the Wilmington affair, had been recieved by the department of justice. 
        Bunting and Melton are all here and have been for ten days or more. They could easily be reached. Mr Benard evidently believes with Congressman Kitchin, that his efforts tog et indictments in the Wilmington case would be unavailing. Said Kitchin: “No grand jury that can be assembled in our state will return indictments against any one in the Wilmington affair.”
        Congressman Strowd has not been here this session.
        White, the negro congressman, appeared in his seat yesterday for the first time.
        Only Kitchin and White of the North Carolina delegation were present when the house adjourned Wednesday for the Christmas holidays, all the others having left the day before for home. 








































September 15, 1899, “Look Blue for Bernard” The Wilson Times(Wilson, North Carolina)
J. Romero
Washington, Sept.- At the Department of Justice officials are judiciously reticent about the most recent escapade of District Attorney Bernard. None will be quoted, and the Attorney General is naturally indignant that a high official of his department, who is sworn to uphold the laws, should be charged with bringing the department into disgrace as well as himself. Marked copies of The Morning Post containing an account of Mr. Shepard at Greenville have been sent to the Attorney-General, and the general feeling is that of disgust and shame.
        As stated in these dispatches several times, the attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina does not stand very high at the Department of Justice, and his official tenure has long hung by a thread. He would have been fired long ago when his loose methods of conducting business was the subject of official inquiry, had not Senator Pritchard put in his saving oar. Again, his jellyfish conduct of the case against the Wilmington “rioters,” so called, showed an utter lack of bone in the back.
        What the present course of the powers that be, will be towards Mr. Benard cannot be definitely asserted. It is certain, however, that he will have to receive backing and support outside of Senator Pritchard who will not uphold the invasion of the home circle even by one whose appointment he secured he is not that kind of a man. 












































December 9, 1898, “From the Shores of the Pacific,” The Semi-Weekly Messenger(Wilmington, North Carolina)
J. Romero
From the Shores of the Pacific
After recounting the conditions antecedent to the 10th of November, the Oregonian of Portland, Oregon speaks sensibly as follows:
        The recital of the facts of this anti negro crusade in North Carolina is essential to full understanding of the situation, and to fair consideration of the appeal made by our colored people and by some of the leading republican newspapers of the east for the interference of the president. In our judgement, nothing can be done to relieve the situation of the south through invoking the interference of the federal government. The governor of North Carolina is a republican elected by the vote of the negroes; he did not interfere; he made no call upon the president. The governor of South Carolina did not interfere nor make any call for federal interference. Under their state governments, these revolutionists and rioters will not be punished; it does not appear that in the overthrow of the municipal government at Wilmington, or in the race riot at Greenwood, any federal law was attacked or obstructed, or any United States official swerve resisted in the exercise of their duties. 
        The president would probably find it difficult to obtain legal ground for interference, but, even if he could interfere legally in the municipal election, like that at Wilmington, he could not interfere effectively. It was a republican congress that refused to give Grant a force in 1874, without which he confessed he could not interfere effectively to suppress such outrages as those in the Carolinas. If the ruling forces of the public opinion in North Carolina are so strongly white that a republican governor elected largely by negro votes dares not interfere; if, as we have proved over and over again during twenty years, no local juries will convict any man put on trial for acts of race violence, of what consequence would be the investigation of a federal attorney general, or the arrest and trial of the leading rioters? When we had the south under bayonet rule, it was not easy to identify, try and convict a kuklux assassin, and since the end of bayonet rule it has been impossible. 
        The situation at the south is deplorable, but it is, we believe, incurable through any outside interference. If there was any danger that President McKinley could or would interfere to upset the uprising municipal government of Wilmington tomorrow, there would be a civil war. The Columbia, (S. C.) State Journal says that, if the North Carolina negroes should “force a war, the whites of South Carolina would cross the line to help their white brethren.” The Richmond Times adds that the Virgnia whites would do the same for “blood is thicker than water.” A mob assaulted and nearly killed a negro in the Northfolk, Va., postoffice who called for mail for “Editor Manly.” whose paper was destroyed in the Wilmington Riot. 
        The situation at the south is one that must be met as a condition as best we can. It cannot be solved by the theoretical expectation of equal legal justice which is generally enforced and obtained at the north. No president can arrest, no government can indict, try, convict and punish a whole people; and that is what would be necessary to punish the acts of violence and revolution that have been recently been committed in the Carolinas and the Mississippi. Nobody can solve the negro problem; nobody can settle the race war at the south, if the state governments and the ruling forces of public opinion in these states are not equal to its solution. The negro must accept the best terms he can get from the ruling white public opinion, not because it is equal justice, but because he cannot help himself. President McKinely is powerless to interfere, and if he were not powerless his interference would only start a storm of resistance which could not be overcome. The whites, whether in the majority or not, will be sure to rule at the south, by right if possible, by might if necessary. What Grant could not maintain by bayonet rule cannot be undone or redressed by McKinely with a marshal and a federal judge. In localities where the negroes are few there will be little difficulty. But in localities where they are numerous they will not be permitted the exercise of political rights, for the result would result in negro government. The endowment of the blacks with the full right of suffrage was the greatest mistake ever made in our political history. It has only brought trouble to them and increased beyond measure the political difficulties of the country. Since the error is now seen in its results, it may as well be frankly confessed. It mocks the negroes with bestowal of a franchise which the masse of them will not be permitted to exercise, and, in fact, are unfit to exercise, and brings on a race war in which they will in every case be trodden down. Since this is the demonstrated result, there is no need to deceive ourselves about it. Abstention of the blacks from politics and in particular from combinations to elect person of their own races to office is necessary alike for their safety and for the public place; for the whites will not submit to negro government.
