[Special Dispatch to the Louisville Courier.]
Memphis, May 1, P.M.
The city is now in a great state of excitement over a riot which originated between some negroes and policemen about five o'clock this afternoon. The policemen, firemen, and regular troops have been called out in force. 
Two policemen named James Finn and Slatery have been seriously wounded, and Henry Dunn, Engineer of [[Na's]] Fire Company, is mortally wounded. Several other policemen are reported wounded, some mortally, and all seriously.
It is said that thirteen negroes have been killed. Seven have been seen lying dead. The riot originated from a fuss between a negro and a white boy. Under the present high state of excitement it is impossible to obtain reliable reports.
The Board of Aldermen met this evening, but adjourned without doing any business. The Mayor afterwards called a special meeting and issued the following:
Gentlemen of the Board of Aldermen:
I find, as well as you and all good citizens, that the disturbance between the blacks and whites this evening requires prompt action on our part. In the absence of proper military aid, therefore, please authorize me, as Mayor, to secure such aid as may be required to quell and suppress all disturbance, and I will do it.
[Signed]. [[John]] Park, Mayor.
After remarks from several members of the Board, it adjourned without any action on this message.
A late report says the regulars are not out but they will be out shortly. The Mayor is drunk and unfit for the emergency.
LATER
Memphis, May 1.
The Sixteenth Regular Infantry has since been called out.
Another negro has been shot.
It is said that two white men were in with the negroes, and that white women on Causey street put their heads out of the windows, and bellowed "hurrah for the negroes!" This is an actual fact, but it is impossible to account for it. 
The streets are full of people, but entirely clear of negroes, as upon their first appearance they are shot down. A negro was almost beat to death a few moments ago on Adams street; another was shot dead near Court Square, and a third one killed near the [[Gayoro]] House.
Capt. J. A. Hood, acting local editor of the Memphis Argus, narrowly escaped being shot through both legs by a Minnie ball, which passed throughout his coat and pants. The mob of negroes, Capt. Hood says, consisted of over one hundred and fifty, all armed with Minnie rifles, pistoles and knives. 
There has been considerable indiscrimate shooting by citizens, who are enraged, and perfectly wild with excitment. 
This has been a clear lesson to the negroes which will teach them to behave themselves.
I do not anticipate that there will be any further disturbance--but few will promenade the streets for days to come.
None of the negroes have yet been arrested. Two are lying dead in the station house.
