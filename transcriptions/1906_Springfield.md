NEGROES LYNCHED
Three Are Hanged and Burned At Springfield, Mo.
CITY IS UNDER MARTIAL LAW
Race War That May Mean Much- Militia Called Out-Both Races Said to Be Armed.
Springfield, Mo., April 16.-A mob of 3000 men and boys took two ne- groes, Horace Duncan and Jim Cope- land, from the Greene county jail shortly before midnight, Saturday, hanged them to the statute of the Goddess of Liberty in the public square, and then built a fire under the bodies.
Two hours later the mob returned to the jail, took out another negro, Will Allen, accused of murder, and lynched him also.
The two negroes first lynched were accused of assaulting Miss Mabel Ed- monson, a young white woman who came here from Monett, Mo., Friday, to work as a domestic.
Miss Edmonson went driving Friday night with a man named Charles Cooper. In a secluded part of the city the couple were held up by two negroes. The man was knocked un- conscious and the girl dragged from the buggy and abused.
Duncan and Copeland were suspect- ed and arrested. They were only par- tially identified, and their employer vouched for an alibi for them, but the mob was bent on vengeance and in no mood to discriminate between guilt and innocence.
Prosecuting Attorney Patterson will ask Judge Lincoln to call a special grand jury to investigate the matter thoroughly, and many arrests are ex- pected to follow.
The mob seemed filled with the spirit of "The Clansman," which cre- ated such a strong anti-negro feeling here six weeks ago.
A story went around that the mob was led by Polk county people, from where Miss Edmonson was reared, but Sheriff Crane says that this is not true.
Two months ago T. M. Kinney, a prominent tailor, was assassinated, and two negro suspects are in jail. Later an old peddler was killed, and negroes were accused of that. This created a strong anti-negro feeling.
It was in fear that a tragedy would be enacted that caused a delegation of negroes to try to prevent the play, "The Clansman," from being given here.
Monett, Peirce City, Rogers, Ark., and several other towns around here have driven the negroes out, and they have congregated in Springfield. It is feared that they may be run out of here the same as in other cities, so bitter has become the feeling.
Wrong Men Hanged. 
Springfield, Mo., April 16.-Quiet prevailed today and indications were that the race trouble is over. The presence of troops had the effect of bringing the people to a full realiza- tion of the situation.
The last of the state militia ordered here by Governor Folk arrived early today. Six companies now patrol the streets.
With the first appearance of soldiers last evening there came a revulsion of sentiment. Before midnight a decided reaction had set in. People began to condemn the action of the mobs that lynched the three negroes and burned their bodies.
Today this feeling has gained strength, especially when it became thoroughly appreciated that Mabel Edmondson, the white domestic, had declared positively that Dunacn and Copeland, two of the negroes lynched, were not her assailants.
This was also heightened by the ar- rival from Jefferson City of the as- sistant attorney sent by the governor to aid the county officials, in ferret- ing out and prosecuting the members of the mob, the rames of many of whom are known.
Judge Lincoln, of the criminal court, today ordered a special grand jury convened Tuesday to make an inves- tigation of the lynching. The jury will be instructed to indict all leaders that may be apprehended. The better class of citizens is strong today in the demands that rioters be punished by the law.
Under directions of Captain Willis, of Company H, Nevada, Mo., who is officer of the day, the soldiers pitched their tents today. Outposts were maintained during the night on all the principal streets leading to the jail. No disturbance of any kind was re- ported.
Today negroes who had fled to the woods returned to their homes, and many others who had hidden them- selves in their homes appeared upon the streets.
Crowds of people today still walked the streets, but no attempt was made to interfere with the negroes.
All Danger Not Passed.
Kansas City, April 16.-A special to the Star, written by a staff writer sent to Springfield, Mo., says:
"Notwithstanding the presence of troops, the streets today are full of people who approve the work of the mob and who damn all negroes, and advise that they be run out of town. 
"All danger of mob violence has not passed. Hundreds of men openly curse and jeer the soldiers.
"Hundreds of men boldly utter the threat that if arrests are made the people will arise and rescue the ar- rested men, and drive the militia as well as the negroes out of the city.
"Everywhere this threat is heard, ‘This town is too small for niggers and whites to live in. One or the other must go.’
"A negro leaning against the court house with the torops near by remark- ed today, 'Give the colored men guns! and we'll show you.'
"Several white men threatened to close in upon the negro, when the officers hustled him off to jail.
Troops to Remain There. 
Jefferson City, April 16.-Governor Folk at noon issued instructions to Adjutant General DeArmond to direct General H. C. Clark, in command of the militia at Springfield, to arrest the leaders of the Saturday night mob, put them in jail and surround the jail with troops for protection. governor stated that the militia would be kept at Springfield until quiet and order are restored.
The Situation Summarized.
The Globe-Democrat of this (Mon- day) morning had the following sum- mary of the situation:
With six companies of state torops and 300 extra policemen on duty at Springfield, following the triple lynch- ing on Saturday night, the city is out- wardly quiet, but volcanic symptoms are manifest.
Whites and blacks are reported as having armed themselves almost to the capacity of business houses to sup- ply them, and the negroes are said to have seized 300 sticks of dynamite from a rock quarry for defense pur- poses.
Governor Folk orders out six com- panies of militia, which Gen. Harvey C. Clark, of Butler, will command; he also offers a reward of $300 each for the arrest and conviction of mob mem- bers, and ordered Assistant Attorney General Gentry to co-operate with Prosecuting Attorney Pattison, of Greene county, in puruing and meting out punishment to the lynchers.
The Ministerial alliance of Spring- field, supported by scores of business and professional citizens, formally de- mands that the hand of justice fall upon the mob members, and calls a mass meeting for tonight to provide ways and means for the purpose in hand. Special indignation was arous- ed by the public offering for sale of grewsome relics of the riotous revel.
Sheriff Horner, it is declared, did not telegraph Governor Folk of the condition prevailing until late Sunday afternoon. It is further reported that the sheriff, when the jail was assailed by the mob, ordered his men not to fire.
Miss Edmondson, the attack upon whom provoked the lynching out- break, when told of the work of ven- geance, observed: "Served them right." Her condition is pronounced serious.
Will Alllen, the last of the trio lynched, was twice hanged, though the first is believed to have produced death.
None of the fourteen negro prison- ers who escaped from jail following the first visit of the mob has been recaptured.
Governor Folk will not visit St. Louis today to meet governors of oth-1 er states, as arranged, unless assured that danger at Springfield is past.
