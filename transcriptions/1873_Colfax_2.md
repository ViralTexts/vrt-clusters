EASTER SUNDAY SIX YEARS AGO. 
Last Sunday was the anniversary of the "Colfax Riot," which occurred on Easter Sunday, the 13th day of April, 1873. The day of the week, day of the month, and the movable festival of Easter all came together just as on that memorable occasion, but with the marked difference that whereas the negroes and whites were on. the Easter Sunday six years ago engaged in deadly strife, brought about by a set of the most villain- ous scoundrels that ever went un- bung, on this Easter they met in friendly conversation, and in many instances listened to the story of Him who arose on that day, and who taught men while on earth to lay aside evil passions and "dwell together in harmony."
