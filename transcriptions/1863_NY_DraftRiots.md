THE DRAFT. 

RIOT IN THE NINTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. 

The Building Set on Fife. 
Several Men Badly Beaten.
The DRAFT DESTROYED 
THE MOB CUTTING TELEGRAPH WORKS. 

From the Tribune extra. 

At the appointed hour for resuming the draft this morning in the IXth Congressional District, at the corner of Third avenue and 46th street, the place was completely besieged by a large crowd of angry and excited men, who were evidently bent on resisting the further drawing of names. It was said that the men were employees of the Second, Sixth, and Seventh avenue Railroads, and of the numerous manufactories in the upper part of the city. 

The crowd, many of whom it is said were armed, paraded the uptown streets gathering accessories to their ranks as they marched along until they finally halted and completely surrounded the Provost Marshal's Office. The employees of the Second Avenue Railroad refused to work, and the employees of the Sixth Avenue Railroad asked leave of absencee, , threatening to burn the depot if they were refused. 

In view of this state of affairs, Provost Marshal Jenkins [??] communicated with Provost Marshal General Nugent, and called upon the police to aid him. ln a little time sections of police from several of the uptown Wards, numbering In all about 200 men, arrived upon the ground, but were unable to contend with the large and excIted crowd which had by this time (10 'clock) assembled. 

The rioters completely blocked up the street, and seizing upon the conductor and driver of one of the cars, beat them badly. They finally succeeded in getting into the office, when they destroyed the ballots and handled the drafting offcer rather roughly. In a little time thereafter it was discovered that the building was on tire, when an alarm was raised which brought the firemen to the ground. 

At this juncture our reporter left the ground.

LATER. 
Special Dispatch of the N.Y. Tribune

FORTY FOURTH STREET, Monday July 13. 
There is an ugly riot up third avenue. The mob have set the building on fire, and driven out the drafting officers; they are cutting down all telegraph wires. No fire-bells are allowed to ring nor firemen to act. A whole block is burning now at 11 o'clock, at the corner of 46th street.

LATEST. 
The rioters cut the telegraph wire, so that communication could not be had with the Central Police Ofice. 

As soon as the fire bells rang the firemen huried to the ground, but ascertaing that it was the Provost Marshal’s Office, they retraced their steps and left the place to burn. 

In every direction threats were made against Col. Nugent, the rioter declaring that they would hang him it they caught him.

At noon there were upwards of 20,000 persons on the third avenue and contiguous streets, some of whom were armed with pitchforks and other implements. The number of rioters is constantly increasing.  

Col. Nugent deeming that the mob might pay a visit to the headquarters, removed his most valuable papers to a place of security.

Latest Particulars. 
FROM OUR OWN REFORTER. 

The City of New York is in a furore of excitement. The mob is apparent everywhere. In the lower part of the City crowds inspect the city railroad cars as they arrive in the vicinity of the City Hail, and if any colored persons are found, either male or female. they are held by one or more of the mob through the windows until others go inside, get hold of them and drag them into the street.

A plot bas been discovered relative to an attack upon some of the newspapers which are known to be supporters of the Government. 

The telegraph wires have been cut, and in some cases the poles smashed so as to prevent communication with the Central Police Station. Mr. Superintendent Kennedy, on the arrival of the information that a mob was in progress, at once repaired to the spot, where, while engaged in directing the operations of the police, he was assailed by the mob, and wounded in a very serious manner. He was removed to Police Headquarters, where he is now under proper medical treatment. 

Inspectors Carpenter. [D?] and Leonard are actively engaged in the direction of of the police force. 

Mr. Commissioner Acton is communicating as rapid as possible with the different precincts as to the disposition of the force in the emergency. 

We are informed that the Chief Engineers of New York and Brooklyn, (both districts) are in session at the St. Nicholas Hotel. in Broadway. 
Steps have been taken to insure the restoration ol Peace throughout the city before night.
