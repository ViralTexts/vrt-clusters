Memphis, Tenn., Sept. 7.-The following report of the riot at Clin- ton, Mississippi, Saturday last was received from Jackson to-night:
According to wide and extended notice throughout Hinds county a Republican meeting was assembled in Clinton Saturday. Members of nearly all the Republican clubs in the county were in attendance, with many women and children. A bar- becue was announced, and arrange- ments to feed 3000 persons. Nearly that number was in attendance. Every precaution was taken to have an orderly and successful meeting. The Clinton authorities had not appointed any police.
At 1:30 p.m. the procession filed upon the grounds and speaking commenced, Fifteen minutes af- terwards some Democrats came on the ground and asked for a division of the time in the interest of peace and good feeling. Their request was granted and a joint discussion was had between Johnson, the Dem- ocratic candidate for State Senator, and Captain Fisher, editor of the Jackson Times.
Johnson spoke over an hour when Fisher took the stand. He regard- this as an auspicious opening of the campaign in the county, and express- ed the hope that the same good feel- ing would prevail in all their meet- ings. He spoke in this strain about eight minutes, when he saw persons on the outskirts of the crowd leav- ing to the scene of a difficulty about fifty yards distant.
The speaker paused and urged the audience to remain, but excited words drew most of them away and he stopped to await their return. In about three minutes three shots were fired, and in a moment fifty shots seemed to be discharged amid the wildest confusion. Women and children broke and leit in a stam. pede. In the course of fifteen min- utes three whites and several colored men were killed. A large majority of the blacks were unarmed, having been cautioned against carrying weapons to the meeting. The diff- culty was unsought by them, and they acted in self-defense.
By 5 o'clock not a colored man was seen on the grounds. Armed whites came out from Clinton and took possession. At the same time the Vicksburg train brought armed men from Edgerton and Bolton. All the colored men they could find were shot down. 120 were killed in cold blood. Armed bands were organized and scoured the country, and the work of slaughter went on.
It is estimated that fifty men were killed in this, Way county, Sunday. Those who were not killed had to flee to the woods for safety. A complete reign of terror prevails. The civil authorities are utterly powerless to stop the marauding bands. Governor Ames has issued an order commanding the rioters to disperse. The city is full of colored refugees, who dare not return to their homes. They ask nothing but protection.
Gov. Ames is doing all within his power to prevent further bloodshed. No Sheriff's posse is sufficient.
