The Meridican Riot,
A review of the terrible crimes of incendiarism, murder and acts of violence in the disturbances at Meridian on Monday last, will bring out the following prominent facts: 
For months preceding the riot, the town has been in a constant fever of excitement in consequence of the evil teachings and machination of Sturges, the imported MAyor, who devoted himself exclusively to formenting mischief and stirring up strife between the whites and blacks.
On the Saturday before the Monday of the riot, one Bill Clopton, a negro desperado, who belonged to the Sturges clan of mischief-makers, used his pretence of a militia organization to make threatening and insulting demonstrations against the white citizens of the town, and before an angry assemblage of his race, with pistol in hand boasted of his murderous intentions, and proclaimed that one hundred blacks could whip a thousand white men, &c. That others joined him from the same stand in similar warlike demonstrations, among thenm Aaron Moore, negro member of the Legislature, who as a Prophet of Evil foretold that the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah would soon overtake the town of Meridian.
That on the very night of the day on which these revengeful threats were made, a fire was discovered in the store of Sturges, which was largely insured, and which speedily communicated to other buildings, consisting of inflamable material, and destroyed a vast deal of valuable property belonging to citizens on which there was either no insurance at all, or but partial insurance.
That the flames were in progress the same Bill Clopton and his clan were flourishing their weapons and indulging in savage exultations over the calamity, calling on the colored people not to assist in putting out the fire, exclaiming, "Let the damned rebel property burn, we've been working for 'em long enough," and that he provoked a difficulty with the fire was raging and but for the interposition of a colored man, would have murdered his intented victim.
That soon therafter the African church bell was rung it was supposed as a signal for the assembling of the incendiaries.
That a number of citizens placed themselves at the disposal of the Sheriff as a posse to prevent further disturbance of the peace, which was threatened, and that with this posse he arrested the ringleaders. 
That on Monday while the cases of Clopton and others were undergoing investigation in the Magistrate's Court, warren Tyler, one of the prisoners, commenced firing at a witness on the stand, who was at the time in the custody of the City Marshal, and discharged numerous shots in the crowded court-building, killing the Judge (Bramlette) at the first fire. 
That the citizens, having no other alternative, then and not till then took their protection in their own hands--returned the fire of Tyler, killing him and others of the ringleaders of the mob, thus obeying the instinct of self-protection and the law of self-defence. 
While such occurances are to be deeply deplored, they are the natural result of the wicked teachings and examples of bad men upon the ignorant and excitable negro population on whose passions they but too successfully played. In contemplating the whole affair from the beginning to the close, we do not know which most to admire, the fortitude displayed by the citizens in bearing the insults which have been put upon them for the purpose of creating strife, or the courage which they displayed at the tying momemnt and the precision with which they did their work, when the difficulty was precipated after all their earnes and patient efforts to avoid it,
And now we will venture to predict that after this process of purification, if the Governor will appoint a prudent and capable man to the office of Mayor, who has the good of all classes of people at heat, and commands thei rconfidence that there will be no more peacable and law-abiding community in the Union than the town of Meridian.
