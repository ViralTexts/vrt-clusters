David Wyatt Lynched by Belleville Citizens

Colored School Teacher Shoots and Mortally Wounds Charles Hertel, County Superintendent of Schools, Who Refuses to Renew His Certificate.
Crowd of Five Thousand Angry Men Surrounds the Jail' 
Sheriff unable to Save the Prisoner. 

David J. Wyatt, murderer of Supt. Hertel, has just been taken from jail by a mob and hung on the public square. Belleville, IL, June 6. Special. A mob of 5,000 is at the city Jail at midnight tonight demanding that David F. Wyatt, a negro, be surrendered. If he Jailer yields Wyatt will be lynched. The prisoner whose life Is demanded shot and fatally wounded Charles HerteL county superintendent of schools, in his office at 6 o'clock this evening. 

All Negroes Ordered to Leave. 

Every negro In the city was ordered tonight to leave town or suffer the consequences.

So far Sheriff Thompson has succeeded in standing off the mob. He called on the fire department for assistance, and several streams or cold water has temporarily cooled the ardor of the crowd. How long before another assault will be made on the jail is problematical, but the officers are fearful that they may not be able to save the negro's life. 

The news of the Shooting spread quickly ,and in less than fifteen minutes the police station was surrounded by a mob of 500 people, principally business and professional men who pleaded with the officers for the surrender of the negro.

Mayor Kern and Chief of Police Yaekels saw that prompt action was necessary in order to prevent a lynching. They quickly threw a platoon of police in front of the police station and with drawn revolvers and clubs drove back the mob. 

Wyatt Rushed Through Crowd. 

Wyatt, handcuffed to two policemen and surrounded by a strong guard, was then rushed through the lines across the public square, three blocks distant to the Countv Jail where he was placed in the murderers' cell.

The mob soon increased to over 2,000 people and their numbers were increased to 5,000 within an hour. Mayor Kern, Circuit Judge Holder, and other prominent officials addressed the crowd, counseling peace and the law be allowed to take its course, but their words seemed to have little effect. 

Cause of the Shooting. 

The cause of the shooting was the refusal by Supt. Hertel to renew Wyatt's license to teach school. Supt. Hertel had conducted teachers' examinations today, and Wyatt, who had taught school for several years, was one of the contestants for a certificate. His grades were not satisfactory Supt. Hertel refused to issue him a certificate. Wyatt, when told his certificate would not be received, entered Hertel's private office and shot him without warning. The bullet pierced Hertel's right chest, ranging downward. A surgeon says he can live but a short time.

Hertel and George Fielder, his assistant. who was the only witness in the office at the time, struggled with the negro and overpowered and held him until Mayor Fred J. Kern and Officer Fred B. Phlllips, who had heard the report of the revolver while standing on the street in front of the building, rushed into the superintendent's office on the third floor of the courthouse, handcuffed the assassin, and took him to the police station. 

Mr. Hertel was serving his third term superintendent of schools of St. Clair county, having been first elected by the Republicans in 1894, and was a candidate for the Republican nomination for state superintendent two years ago. 

Race War Threatened. 

Tonight's shooting was not the only reason for warning all the negroes to leave the city. There has been considerable friction between the whites and blacks for some time. 

The Rev. Charles Thomas, castor of the African Methodist Episcopal church, has received several threatening letters warning to leave Belleville or suffer personal injuries. He is threatened with visits from white caps and one letter reads that he will be hanged to a telephone pole in the public square if he does not leave the city within forty-eight hours. Thomas has sent the letters to Gov. Yates and appealed to him for protection. 

The letters are believed to be the outgrowth of the recent equal right suit brought by Thomas against Henry Baumgarten, proprietor of one of the leading white barber shops of Belleville, for $200 damages because Baumgarten refused to allow one of his employees to shine the minister's shoes. Thomas entered Baumgarten's barber shop when the place was crowded with patrons and, seating himself in the chair, asked that his shoes be polished. Aware that in serving the negro it would be detrimental to his trade, Baumgarten told the negro preacher that it would be impossible for him to serve him, as his patrons would object to it. Thomas became enraged at this and stated that he was an American citizen and that he had the same rights in the barber shop that other customers had. Baumgarten refused to serve Thomas, and the latter left the place, informing the proprietor that he would institute suit against him. The suit was brought and a jury decided that Baumgarten had a right to refuse to serve the colored preacher. Today Thomas filed an appeal bond with August Hertel a wealthy white citizen, as surety. He says he will carry the case to the Supreme court.
