The Appeal - July 21, 1917  
  
**CRIME AGAINST CIVILIZATION.**  
  
In the opinion of THE APPEAL, the strongest article denouncing the East  
Saint Louis massacre was an editorial published in the Christian  
Register of Boston, Mass. The Regis- ter is the leading Unitarian paper  
pub-lished in the United States and per- haps that accounts for the  
article.  
  
The Unitarian church is one of the few Christian denominations in Amer-  
ica in which there is no color line. The orthodox Christian sects in  
Amer- ica are so filled with prejudice that the ruthless massacre of  
helpless men, women and children fails to bring out a protest.  
  
The article from the Christian Reg- ister, which follows, is not so long  
as some of the articles which have ap- peared in the daily papers, but  
it is evidently the most sincere which THE APPEAL has seen:  
  
The hideous outrage against law and humanity in East St. Louis, Ill.,  
makes us turn again from the barbari-ties of war to the ferocities of  
peace, from crimes against civilization abroad to crimes against  
civilization at home. The testimony of eye witnesses shows that nothing  
is to be learned among white people of this city from the cru-elties and  
brutalities of foreign con- quest. No tribes of any name or time have  
ever outdone the white men and women who burned colored men, women and  
children the other day in this American city. Nothing more re- volting  
was ever charged against Ne\-- groes than was done by these white  
people. The organization of the man- hood of the nation for the  
protection of human life and liberty on the seas and for the deliverance  
of democracy in the world will be needed at home after its task abroad  
is done. While our fellow-creatures in the United States are hunted and  
tortured as if they were wild beasts, government can scarcely be called  
democratic. So long as colored people are proscribed, dis-criminated  
against, segregated and despised, ill-will and antipathy will furnish  
fertilizers of hatred and mur- der.  
  
**PATRIOTIC MID-YEAR EDITION.**  
  
This issue is the Patrotic Mid-Year Edition of THE APPEAL.  
  
THE APPEAL is an American news-paper without any hyphen, prefix or  
suffix.  
  
The editor of THE APPEAL is an American without any hyphen, prefix or  
suffix.  
  
THE APPEAL believes that every person born in the United States is an  
American, should feel that he is an American and should be ready to  
sacri fice all of his possessions and even his life to defend the United  
States.  
  
In return for his loyalty to his na- tive land, THE APPEAL believes that  
every American has the right to ex- pect every right and privilege ac-  
corded to every other American. No land is a democracy in which there.  
are two classes of citizens.  
  
These are the days that we should feel patriotic. One hundred and forty-  
one years ago the United States shook off the bonds of Great Britain and  
be- came independent.  
  
The Declaration of Independence states that \&quot;all men are created equal  
and endowed by their creator with cer- tain inalienable rights among  
which are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. After one hundred  
and forty-one years this ideal has not been realized and our much  
vaunted de- mocracy is largely a sham, but some progress has been made.  
  
We are now at war and it is claimed that we are fighting for world-wide  
democracy, and in spite of the fact that many forces have been at work  
in recent years to retard the growth of democracy, THE APPEAL believes  
that the end of the war will find the United States further advanced in  
true democracy than may appear possible at the present time, and in  
spite of it- self.  
  
Not only the United States but in the whole world we are about to enter  
an era in which the basic principle will be human brotherhood.  
  
**WARNS AGAINST RACIAL HATRED.**  
  
It is so unusual for a Christian minister to preach against racial hat-  
red that THE APPEAL is pleased to note that one minister has the cour-  
age of his convictions.  
  
In his sermon last Sunday, Rev. H. E. Peabody, pastor of the South Con-  
gregational Church, in Chicago, said that racial hatred within the  
United States is more dangerous than all Ger- mans outside this country.  
  
Dr. Peabody likened the East St. Louis massacre to the \&quot;atrocities of  
the unspeakable Turk in Armenia.\&quot;  
  
\&quot;The country\&#x27;s perils are not all on the sea and beyond,\&quot; said Dr.  
Pea- body. \&quot;Think of the moral earthquake and volcano that has burst in  
the midst of the land, in our own state, since last we met.  
  
\&quot;Who would have believed that a massacre that reminds one of St.  
Bartholomew\&#x27;s night and of the atroci- ties of the unspeakable Turk in  
Ar- menia, could occur among our own fellow-citizens in East St. Louis?  
  
\&quot;But, beware! The peril is nearer than that. The mutterings of the vol-  
cano are felt in Chicago. The single explosion is not the most  
significant thing. The race prejudice, contempt and hatred,  
working-working be- neath-these are the hell below-and

riots.  
  
**THE ILLINOIS HORROR**  
  
------------------  
  
**Ashamed to Register From East St. Louis.**  
  
(Chicago Daily American.)  
  
W. R. Neal is manager of a hotel in East St. Louis, Ill. Today when he  
registered at the Congress Hotel he gave his address as St. Louis, Mo.  
\&quot;I\&#x27;m ashamed to say I came from East St. Louis,\&quot; he told the clerk.  
  
------------------  
  
**Brought Disgrace on Lincoln\&#x27;s State.**  
  
(From the Chicago Daily News.)  
  
Mob frenzy displayed in some of its most dreadful forms in East St.  
Louis yesterday has brought disgrace and just reproach upon the state of  
Abra- ham Lincoln.  
  
------------------  
  
**The Most Disgraceful Outbreak.**  
  
(From the Chicago Journal.)  
  
The East St. Louis affair is the most disastrous and disgraceful  
outbreak the state has known for a generation; perhaps the worst it has  
ever known. That, it should come during the heat of a foreign war and on  
the eve of Independence Day makes it still more ominous.  
  
------------------  
  
**The Law Itself on Trial.**  
  
(From the Chicago Herald)  
  
East St. Louis, Ill., the law itself, are all on trial until this grim,  
terrible business is settled and settled rightly Failure of justice  
means a vicious precedent that will plague the com- monwealth for years  
to come. When the issue of law or anarchy is pre- sented as plainly as  
in the orgy at East St. Louis there should be but one answer.  
  
------------------  
  
**The Shame of Illinois.**  
  
(From the Chicago Tribune.)  
  
The riot at East St. Louis is one of the worst blots on the good name of  
an American community in our whole history. Illinois must bow her head  
in shame before this disgrace. We have no excuse. There can be no ex-  
cuse for such a break down of the most primitive safeguards of civil  
gov- ernment, for such betrayal of the first duty of ordered society.  
  
------------------  
  
**Will Sue for Damages.**  
  
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, with  
former Judge Edward Osgood Brown of the appellate court president of the  
local chapter, is planning to institute suits under the Illinois  
statutes against the city of East St. Louis and St. Clair county for  
personal damages on be half of the dependents of the Negro men and women  
who died at the hands of the incensed mobs in the orgy of murder and  
arson several days ago.  
  
Under the statutes, the dependents have actions against both the city  
and the county for damages to property, life and limb, the judgments not  
to ex- ceed \$5,000 in each case. This may mean suits for nearly  
\$1,000,000 when the final loss of the scores killed, the hundreds  
injured and the many homes destroyed is recorded.  
  
------------------  
  
**The Illinois Massacre.**  
  
(From the Chicago Evening Post.)  
  
\&quot;In ouah town we don\&#x27;t let a nig gah get off the train long enough to  
brush youah coat, not even if he\&#x27;s a po\&#x27;tah on a Pullman.\&quot;  
  
They\&#x27;ll tell you this in just these accents in some of the southern  
towns of Illinois.  
  
And it was from these towns that the militiamen came to \&quot;maintain or  
der in East St. Louis.\&quot;  
  
This is the whole story of the fail- ure of the militia in the worst  
race riot that has disgraced Illinois since Lovejoy was martyred.  
  
Troops from Northern Illinois should have been sent into East St. Louis;  
troops from Southern Illinois should not have been sent there. For the  
twi- light zone of the Mason and Dixon line cuts across the central and  
south- ern portions of the state.  
  
------------------  
  
**Greatest Disgrace to State.**  
  
\&quot;I feel very strongly on the sub- ject,\&quot; said Judge Brown today. \&quot;In  
my opinion it is the greatest disgrace upon the name of the state of  
Illinois yet recorded. I\&#x27;m very indignant. Our or ganization is  
watching the proceed- ings there, but we are waiting for the reports of  
the various investigations. I do not want to appear to criticize any one  
at this time. We have faith in Governor Lowden unearthing all the facts.  
At a meeting to be held in the near future we will decide what steps to  
take.\&quot;  
  
\&quot;The society will prosecute suits for damage against the city and  
county for each Negro killed or injured,\&quot; said Dr. Charles E Bentley,  
dentist at 25 East Washington street. \&quot;The stat utes are clear on the  
subject. We will go after the sheriff also if the facts prove our  
beliefs.  
  
\&quot;We are so astonished we can hardly express our feelings. It is most  
outrageous.\&quot;  
  
------------------  
  
**Worse Than Belgium.**  
  
New York, July 3.-\&quot;Swift and se- vere punishment\&quot; for the East St.  
Louis mobs was demanded by the So- cialist leader, William English Wall-  
ing. in a telegram to President Wilson today.  
  
Such punishment is necessary, Wall- ing said, because \&quot;of the  
dangerous. effect of race riots in America en rev- olutionary Russia,  
South America and Japan.\&quot;  
  
Walling characterized the uprising as partly the result of German  
agents\&#x27; efforts to stir up a race war to keep American troops at home  
and partly the result of an attempt by the South- ern states to keep the  
Negro under their thumb.  
  
Speaking as a member of the execu tive committee of the National Asso  
ciation for the Advancement of Col- ored People, Walling, in his  
telegram, said:  
  
\&quot;The international and military sit- uation, calls for immediate  
action, There must be swift and severe pun- ishment for the mob. But  
this will not suffice. There should be an immedi- ate presidential  
proclamation in the present military exigency that the full military  
power of the nation will be used in defense of the lives and lib- erty  
of our colored fellow citizens.\&quot;  
  
**LET AGITATION GO ON, SAYS REV. F. J. GRIMKE.**  
  
**Commends Protest by Guardian and Planet-Race Will Protest Till White  
America Accords the Rights Which Belong to Every American Citizen  
-Steady Decline of Rights Under B. T. Washington Policy.**  
  
(From the Boston Guardian.)  
  
Washington, D. C., June 1, 1917. Dear Mr. Trotter:-I have just read in  
the last issue of the Guardian your editorial, including the editorial  
of Mr. John Mitchell of the Planet, in which he administers a very just  
and timely rebuke to Dr. Frissell for some things which he says in the  
last issue of the Southern Workman.  
  
**Rights Declined Under Washington.**  
  
It is amazing that at this late day, and after the STEADY DECLINE OF OUR  
RIGHTS UNDER MR. WASH- INGTON\&#x27;S POLICY of \&quot;quiet, unpre- tentious  
service.\&quot; that Dr. Frissell should be attempting to revive that  
pernicious, un-American, unmanly, heresay of quiet submission to wrong.  
What God directed his prophet to do was: \&quot;Cry aloud, spare not, lift up  
thy voice like a trumpet, and declare junto my people their  
transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\&quot; And that is what we  
have been doing, and will continue to do, until White America heeds the  
message, turns from its evil ways and accords to the colored man the  
rights which justly belongs to him as much as to any other American  
citizen.  
  
**Let Frissell Understand Once and for - All Time.**  
  
Dr. Frissell had just as well under- stand now, once for all, that the  
policy for which he stands, as regards our rights, will never be  
accepted by the colored man. And the inculcation of such a policy comes  
with very little grace from white men who never think of following it  
when their own rights are involved.  
  
**Think Colored Unlike Whites.**  
  
It is because, after all, they think that the Negro is made of a little  
dif- ferent clay. and therefore that it is alright FOR HIM TO QUIETLY  
SUB- MIT TO WHAT WHITE MEN WOULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO SUBMIT TO, AND,  
WOULD NOT SUBMIT TO WITHOUT THE MOST VIGOROUS PROTEST?  
  
**Put Themselves In Our Place.**  
  
If some of our white friends would put themselves in the place of the  
colored man, and realize that there is no essential difference between  
the colored man and themselves, they would be saved from some of the  
fool- ish things which they recommend at, times.  
  
**Let the Agitation Go On.**  
  
Let the Planet. let the Guardian. let all the colored newspapers,  
continue to speak out, and, in every other legiti mate way, LET THE  
AGITATION GO ON. It is in vain for Dr. Frissell, or any one else to try  
to stop it. Yours for equality of rights for all citizens, regardless of  
race or condi-tion.  
  
FRANCIS J. GRIMKE.  
  
------------------  
  
**Hates the Term \&quot;Negro.\&quot;**  
  
\&quot;I hate the term Negro because it is being used in terms of hatred. It  
is the cause of the segregation of the Negro; it is being used in  
contempt in public places; it is an excuse för disfranchising him; and  
it is an ex- cuse for lynching him. Only one- tenth of one per cent of  
the colored people in America can trace their descent to Africa, and  
there is no more right to call all colored people Negroes than to call  
all white people Turks or Armenians.\&quot;-Ex-Assistant United States  
Attorney General Wm. H. Lewis, Boston, Mass.  
  
------------------  
  
**Mad Savagery**  
  
(Springfield Republican)  
  
While we are so critical of the na- tions known as our enemies it is  
morally disconcerting to have staged in America such mad savagery as the  
latest burning to death of a colored man by a mob in Tennessee. The  
colored man was clearly guilty, it seems, of the fiendish murder of a  
white girl, but retaliation in flendish- ness gets us nowhere in  
correcting or even punishing a criminal class. I When race feeling is  
involved it is Impossible to conceive of anything so disastrous in its  
ultimate effects as the treatment which mobs occasion- ally give to  
these black men. At a time when Americans need to show real capacity for  
mass discipline and respect for authority, we are forced to contemplate  
these hideous specta- cles of mass brutishness and social anarchy.  
  
------------------  
  
**\&quot;Negroes and Dogs Not Allowed\&quot;**  
  
(From the Nashville Clarion)  
  
Down in Houston, Texas are some elevators in public buildings labeled  
\&#x27;NEGROES AND DOGS NOT ALLOW ED.\&quot; Generous Classification! Such signs  
as these account in such meas- ure, for the exceedingly rapid manner in  
which the Colored men are depopu- lating the South. They can be neither  
blamed nor censured\&#x27; for leaving a town like this. They have hearts and  
souls and human pride, just like the people of other races.  
  
------------------  
  
**Must Have a Place in School**  
  
(From the Chicago Defender)  
  
Our naval training camp has every nationality under the sun. As a red  
flag to flout into the face of the bull, we have Chinamen out there, the  
Filipino out there, the Greek out there, the Hebrew out there, the  
Italian out there, and God himself only knows what else out there, but  
we do know that if we are anywhere near there we are near the bathroom  
with a mop and broom. Space must be made for the boy of the Colored race  
in the school for which we are paying taxes.  
  
------------------  
  
**The Eternal Gospel**  
  
(From the Martinsville Pioneer-Press)  
  
We have no respect for a servile, cringing colored man. He is of more  
service to his people under the sod than on top of it.-Richmond (Va)  
Planet. That is our eternal gospel, preach it in the valleys and on the  
mountain tops.  
  
------------------  
  
**Not Consistent**  
  
(Baltimore (Md.) Commonwealth)  
  
President Wilson cannot consistent- ly contend for liberty, equality and  
justice for Belgians, Russians, Poles, French, English and Teutons  
without conceding justice, liberty and equal- ity to ALL citizens of his  
own coun- try.

This paper has no retraction to  
make in the Major Moton affair. It  
thought then and knows now that no  
improvement was made by his pro­  
motion. Booker T. Washington&#x27;s pal­  
liation gave us double work for man­  
hood rights not only in the South but  
the North as well for untold years to  
come, and his successor&#x27;s ambition is  
to be patted on the back and be called  
&quot;a good darkey&quot;to the lower regions  
with the &quot;good darkey&quot; class. Any  
man who goes back on his wife when  
abused for contending for her rights  
paid for, to ride in a Pullman car, is  
unfit to lead and teach our children  
Hates the Term &quot;Negro.&quot;  
&quot;I hate the term Negro because it  
is being used in terms of hatred. It  
is the cause of the segregation of the  
Negro it is being used in contempt  
in public places it is an excuse for  
disfranchising him and it is an ex­  
cuse for lynching him. Only one­  
tenth of one per cent of the colored  
people in America can trace their  
descent to Africa, and there is no  
more right to call all colored people  
Negroes than to call all white people  
Turks or Armenians.&quot;Ex-Assistant

Belong to Every American Citizen  
Steady Decline of Rights Under  
B. T. Washington Policy.  
(From the Boston Guardian.)  
Washington, D. C, May 1, 1917  
Dear Mr. TrotterI have just read  
in the last issue of the Guardian your  
editorial, including the editorial of Mr.  
John Mitchell of the Planet, in which  
administers a ver just and timely  
^e to Dr._Frissely for some things  
which he says in the last issue of the  
Southern Workman  
Rights Declined Under Washington.  
It is amazing that at this late day,  
and after the STEADY DECLINE OF  
OUR RIGHTS UNDER MR. WASH­  
INGTON&#x27;S POLICY of &quot;quiet, unpre­  
tentious service.&quot; that Dr. Frissell  
should be attempting to revive that  
pernicious, un-American, unmanly,  
heresay of quiet submission to wrong.  
What God directed his prophet to do  
was- &quot;Cry aloud, spare not, lift up  
thy voice like a trumpet, and declare  
unto my people their transgression,  
and the house of Jacob their sins.&quot;  
And that is what we have been doing,  
and will continue to do, until White  
America heeds the message, turns

It is amazing that at this late day,

OUR RIGHTS UNDER MR. WASH­  
INGTON&#x27;S POLICY of &quot;quiet, unpre­  
tentious service.&quot; that Dr. Frissell

pernicious, un-American, unmanly,  
heresay of quiet submission to wrong.  
What God directed his prophet to do  
was- &quot;Cry aloud, spare not, lift up  
thy voice like a trumpet, and declare  
unto my people their transgression,  
and the house of Jacob their _sins.&quot;  
And that is what we have been doing  
and will continue to do, until White  
America heeds the message, turns  
from its evil ways and accords to the  
colored man the rights which justly  
belongs to him as much as to any

Mad Savagery  
(Springfield Republican)  
While we are so critical of the na­  
tions known as our enemies it is  
morally disconcerting tp have staged  
in America such mad savagery as the  
latest burning to death of a colored  
man by a mob in Tennessee. The  
colored man was clearly guilty, it  
seems, of the fiendish murder of a  
white girl, but retaliation in fiendish­  
ness gets us nowhere in correcting  
or even punishing a criminal class.  
When race feeling is involved it is  
impossible to conceive of anything so  
disastrous in its ultimate effects as  
the treatment which mobs occasion­  
ally give to these black men At a  
time when Americans need to show  
real capacity for mass discipline and  
respect for authority, we are forced  
to contemplate these hideous specta­  
cles of mass brutishness and social  
anarchy

Some of the papers are making a great &quot;to do&quot; over the election of a  
suffragan bishop calling it &quot;progress.&quot; As a matter of fact a suffragan bishop  
is a &quot;jim crow&quot; bishop. He has no real power and is subject to the whims  
and caprices of the bishop under whom he serves. The election of such a  
bishop is an emphatic drawing of the color line. It is not progress, but  
retrogression.

land is a democracy in which there  
are two classes of citizens.  
These are the days that we should  
feel patriotic. One hundred and forty­  
one years ago the United States shook  
off the bonds of Great Britain and be­  
came independent.  
The Declaration of Independence  
states that &quot;all men are created equal  
and endowed by their creator with cer­  
tain inalienable rights among which  
are life, liberty and the pursuit of  
happiness. After one hundred and  
forty-one years this ideal has not been  
realized and our much vaunted de­  
mocracy is largely a sham, but some  
progress has been made.  
We are now at war and it is claimed  
that we are fighting for world-wide  
democracy, and in spite of the fact  
that many forces have been at work  
in recent years to retard the growth  
of democracy, THE APPEAL believes  
that the end of the war will find the  
United States further advanced in true  
democracy than may appear possible  
at the present time, and in spite of it­  
self.

RACE RIOT WORSE THAN BEL­  
GIUM, SOCIALIST SAYS.  
  
New York, July. &quot;Swift and severe  
punishment&quot; for the East St. Louis  
mobs was demanded by the Socialist  
leader, William English Walling, in a  
telegram to President Wilson today.  
Such punishment is necessary, Mr.  
Walling said, because &quot;of the dan­  
gerous effect of race riots in America  
on revolutionary Russia, South Amer­  
ica, and Japan.&quot;  
Mr. Walling characterized the upris­  
ing as partly the result of German  
agents&#x27; efforts to stir up a race war to  
keep American troops at home and  
partly the result of an attempt by the  
southern states to keep the Negro un­  
der their thumb.  
Speaking as a member of the exec­  
utive committee of the National Asso­  
ciation for the Advancement of Colored  
People, Mr. Walling, in his telegram,  
said:  
&quot;The international and military situ­  
ation calls for immediate action. There  
must be swift and severe punishment  
for the mob. But this will not suffice.  
There should be an immediate presiden­  
tial proclamation in the present mili­  
tary exigency that the full military  
power of the nation will be used in  
defense of the lives and liberty of our  
Colored fellow citizens.&quot;

The National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People, with  
former Judge Edward^ Osgood Brown  
of the appellate court president of the  
local&#x27;chapter, is planning to institute  
suits under the Illinois statutes against  
the city of East St. Louis and St. Clair  
county for personal damages on be­  
half of the dependents of the Negro  
men and women who died at the hands  
of the incejigaft mobs in the orgy of  
murder and arson several days ago.  
Under the &quot;statutes, the dependents  
have actions against both the city and  
the county for damages to property,  
life and limb, the judgments not to ex­  
ceed $5,000 in each case. This may  
mean suits for nearly $1,000,000 when  
the final loss of the scores killed, the  
hundreds injured and the many homes  
destroyed is recorded.  
The Illinois Massacre.  
(From the Chicago Evening Post.)  
&quot;In ouah town we don&#x27;t let a nig­  
gah get off the train long enough to  
p0 &#x27;tah on a Pullman.&quot;  
They&#x27;ll tell you this in just these  
accents in some of the southern towns  
of Illinois.  
And it was from these towns that  
the militiamen came to &quot;maintain or­  
der in East St. Louis.&quot;  
This is the whole story of the fail­  
ure of the militia in the worst race  
riot that has disgraced Illinois since  
Lovejoy was martyred.  
Troops from Northern Illinois should  
have been sent into East St. Louis  
troops from Southern Illinois should  
not have been sent there. For the twi­  
light zone of the Mason and Dixon  
line cuts across the central and south­  
ern portions of the state.  
Greatest Disgrace to State.  
&quot;I feel very strongly~on the sub-  
ject,&quot; said Judge Brown today. &quot;In my  
opinion it is the greatest disgrace upon  
the name of the state of Illinois yet  
recorded. I&#x27;m&#x27; very indignant. Our or­  
ganization is watching the proceed­  
ings there, but we are waiting for the  
reports of the various investigations.  
I do not want to appear to criticize  
any one at this time. W have faith  
in Governor Lowden unearthing all  
the facts. At a meeting to be held in  
the near future we will decide what  
steps to take.&#x27;&#x27;  
&quot;The society will prosecute suits for  
damage against the city and county for  
each Negro killed or injured,&quot; said  
Dr. Charles E. Bentley, dentist at 25  
East Washington street. &quot;The stat­  
utes are clean on the subject. W will  
.go after the sheriff also if the facts  
prove our beliefs.  
&quot;We are so astonished we can  
hardly express our feelings. It is most  
outrageous.

tive land, THE APPEAL believes that  
every American has the right to ex- lings of democracy are being heard,  
pect every right and privilege ac­  
corded to every other American. No  
land is a democracy in which there  
are two classes of citizens.  
These are the days that we should  
feel patriotic. One hundred and forty­  
one years ago the United States shook  
off the bonds of Great Britain and be­  
came independent.  
The Declaration of Independence  
states that &quot;all men are created equal  
and endowed by their creator with cer­  
tain inalienable rights among which  
are life, liberty and the pursuit of  
happiness. After one hundred and  
forty-one years this ideal has not been  
realized and our much vaunted de­  
mocracy is largely a sham, but some  
progress has been made.  
We are now at war and it is claimed  
that we are fighting for world-wide  
democracy, and in spite of the fact  
that many forces have been at work  
in recent years to retard the growth  
of democracy, THE APPEAL believes  
that the end of the war will find the  
United States further advanced in true  
democracy than may appear possible  
at the present time, and in spite of it­  
self.

Commends Protest by Guardian and&#x27;  
PlanetRace Will Protest Till White  
America Accords the Rights Which  
Belong to Every American Citizen  
Steady Decline of Rights Under  
B. T. Washington Policy.  
(From the Boston Guardian.)  
Washington, D. C, June 1, 1917.  
Dear Mr. Trotter:I have just read  
in the last issue of the Guardian your  
editorial, including the editorial of Mr.  
John Mitchell of the Planet, in which  
he administers a very just and timely  
rebuke to Dr. Frissell for some things  
which he says in the last issue of the  
Southern Workman.  
Rights Declined Under Washington.  
It is amazing that at this late day,  
and after the STEADY DECLINE OF  
OUR RIGHTS UNDER MR. WASH­  
INGTON&#x27;S POLICY of &quot;quiet, unpre­  
tentious service.&quot; that Dr. Frissell  
should be attempting to revive that  
pernicious, un-American, unmanly,  
heresay of quiet submission to wrong.  
What God directed his prophet to do  
was: &quot;Cry aloud, spare not, lift up  
thy voice like a trumpet, and declare  
unto my people their transgression,  
and the house of Jacob their sins.&quot;  
And that is what we have been doing,  
and will continue to do, until White  
America heeds the message, turns  
from its evil ways and accords to the  
colored man the rights which justly  
belongs to him as much as to any  
otheiv American citizen.  
Let Frissell Understand Once and for  
All Time.  
Dr. Frissell had just as well under­  
stand now, once for all, that the policy  
for which he stands, as regards oui  
rights, will never be accepted by the  
colored man. And the inculcation of  
such a policy comes&#x27;with very little  
grace from white men who never  
of following it when their own  
rights are involved.  
Think Cofored Unlike Whites.  
It is because, after all, they think  
that the Negro is made of a little dif­  
ferent clay, and therefore that it is  
alright FOR HIM TO QUIETLY SUB­  
MIT TO WHAT WHITE MEN  
WOULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO  
SUBMIT TO, AND, WOULD NOT  
SUBMIT TO WITHOUT THE MOST  
VIGOROUS PROTEST?  
Put Themselves In Our Place.  
If some of our white friends would  
put themselves in the place of the  
colored man, and realize that there is  
no essential difference between the  
colored man and themselves, they  
would be saved from some of jthe fool­  
ish things which they recommend at  
times.  
Let the Agitation Go On.  
Let the Planet, let the Guardian, let  
all the colored newspapers, continue  
speak out, and, in every other legiti­  
mate way, LET THE AGITATION GO  
ON It is in vain for Dr. Frissell, or  
any one else to try to stop it.  
Yours for equality of rights for all  
citizens, regardless of race or condi­  
tion.

Mad Savagery  
(Springfield Republican)  
While we are so critical of the na­  
tions known as our enemies it is  
morally disconcerting to have staged  
in America such mad savagery as the  
latest burning to death of a colored  
man by a mob in Tennessee:&quot; The  
colored man was clearly guilty, it  
seems, of the fiendish murder of a  
white girl, but retaliation in fiendish­  
ness gets us nowhere correcting  
or even punishing a criminal class.  
When race feeling is involved it is  
impossible to conceive of anything so  
disastrous in its ultimate effects as  
the treatment which mobs occasion­  
ally give to these black men. At a  
time when Americans need to show  
real capacity for mass discipline and  
respect for authority, we are forced  
to contemplate these hideous specta­  
cles of mass brutishness and social  
anarchy.

CRIME AGAINST CIVILIZATION*.  
Jn the opinion of THE APPEAL,  
the strongest article denouncing the  
East Saint Louis massacre was an  
editorial published in the Christian  
Register of Boston, Mass. The Regis­  
ter is the leading Unitarian paper pub­  
lished in the United States and per­  
haps that accounts for the article.  
The Unitarian church is one of the  
few Christian denominations in Amer­  
ica in which there is no color line.  
The orthodox Christian sects in Amer­  
ica are so filled with prejudice that  
the ruthless massacre of helpless men,  
women and children fails to bring out  
a protest.  
The article from the Christian Reg­  
ister, which follows, is not so long as  
some of the articles which have ap­  
peared in the daily papers, but it is  
evidently the most sincere which THE  
APPEAL has seen:  
The hideous outrage against law  
and humanity in East St. Louis, 111,  
makes us turn again from the barbari­  
ties of war to the ferocities of peace,  
from crimes against civilization abroad  
to crimes against civilization at home.  
The testimony of eye witnesses shows  
that nothing is to be learned among  
white people of this city &#x27;from the cru­  
elties and brutalities of foreign con­  
quest No tribes of any name or time  
have ever outdone the white men and  
women who burned colored men,  
women and children the other day in  
this American city. Nothing more re­  
volting was ever charged against Ne­  
groes than was done by these white  
people. The organization of the man­  
hood of the nation for the protection  
of human life and liberty on the seas  
and for the deliverance of democracy  
in the world will be needed at home  
after its task abroad is done. While  
our fellow-creatures in the United  
States are hunted and tortured as if  
they were wild beasts, government can  
scarcely be called democratic So long  
as colored people are proscribed, dis­  
criminated against, segregated and  
despised, ill-will and antipathy will  
furnish fertilizers of hatred and mur­  
der.  
PATRIOTIC MID-YEAR EDITION.  
This issue is the Patriotic Mid-Year  
Edition of THE APPEAL.  
THE APPEAL is an American news-  
paper without any hyphen, prefix or  
suffix.  
The editor of THE APPEAL is an  
American without any hyphen, prefix  
or suffix.  
THE APPEAL believes that every  
person born in the United States is an  
American, should feel that he is an  
American and should be ready to sacri­  
fice all of his possessions and even  
his life to defend the United States.  
In return for his loyalty to his na­  
tive land, THE APPEAL believes that  
every American has the right to ex­  
pect every right and privilege ac­  
corded to every other American. No  
land is a democracy in which there  
are two classes of citizens.  
These are the days that we should  
feel patriotic. One hundred and forty­  
one years ago the United States shook  
off the bonds of Great Britain and be­  
came independent.  
The Declaration of Independence  
states that &quot;all men are created equal  
and endowed by their creator with cer­  
tain inalienable rights among which  
are life, liberty and the pursuit of  
happiness. After one hundred and  
forty-one years this ideal has not been  
realized and our much vaunted de­  
mocracy is largely a sham, but some  
progress has been made  
We are now at war and it is claimed  
that we are fighting for world-wide  
democracy, and in spite of the fact  
that many forces have been at work  
in rpcent years to retard the growth  
of democracy, THE APPEAL believes  
that the end of the war will find the  
United States further advanced in true  
democracy than may appear possible  
at the present time, and in spite of it­  
self  
Not only the United States but in  
the whole world we are about to enter  
an era in which the basic principle  
will be human brotherhood.  
WARNS AGAINST RACIAL HATRED.  
It ig so unusual for a Christian  
minister to preach against racial hat­  
red that THE APPEAL is .pleased to  
note that one minister has the cour­  
age of his convictions.  
In his sermon last Sunday, Rev. H.  
E. Peabody, pastor of the South Con­  
gregational Church, in Chicago, said  
that racial hatred within the United  
States is more dangerous than all Ger­  
mans outside this country.  
Dr. Peabody likened the East St  
Louis massacre to the &quot;atrocities of  
the unspeakable Turk in Armenia.&quot;  
&quot;The country&#x27;s perils are not all on  
the sea and beyond,&quot; said Dr. Pea­  
body. &quot;Think of the moral earthquake  
and volcano that has burst in the  
midst of the land, in our own state,  
since last we met.  
&quot;Who would have believed that a  
massacre that reminds one of St.  
Bartholomew&#x27;s night and of the atroci­  
ties of thje unspeakable Turk in Ar­  
menia, could occur among our own  
fellow-citizens in East St. Louis?  
&quot;But, beware! The peril is nearer  
than that. The mutterings of the vol­  
cano t,re felt in Chicago. The single  
explosion is not the most significant  
thing. The race prejudice, contempt  
and hatred, workingworking be­  
neaththese are the hell belowan

teer army. Colored men are not per­  
mitted to enlist and must wait for the

Ashamed to Register From East  
St. Louis.  
(Chicago Daily American.)  
W. R. Neal is manager of a hotel  
in East St. Louis, 111. Today when  
he, registered at the Congress Hotel  
he gave his address as St. Louis, Mo  
&quot;I&#x27;m ashamed to say I came from  
East St. Louis,&quot; he told the clerk.  
Brought Disgrace on Lincoln&#x27;s State.  
(From the Chicago Daily News.)  
Mob frenzy displayed in some of its  
most dreadful forms in East St. Louis  
yesterday has brought disgrace and  
just reproach upon the state of Abra­  
ham Lincoln.^  
The Most Disgraceful Outbreak.  
(From the Chicago Journal.)  
The East St. Louis affair is the most  
disastrous and disgraceful outbreak  
the state has known for a generation  
perhaps the worst it has ever known.  
That it should come during the heat  
of a foreign war and on the eve of  
Independence Day makes it still more  
ominous.  
The Law Itself on Trial.  
(From the Chicago Herald.)  
East St. Louis, 111., the law itself,  
are all on trial until this grim, terrible  
business is settled and settled rightly  
Failure of justice means a vicious  
precedent that will plague the com­  
monwealth for years to come. When  
the issue of -law or anarchy is pre­  
sented as plainly as in the orgy at  
East St. Louis there should be but  
one answer.  
The Shame of Illinois.  
(From the Chicago Tribune.)  
The not at East St. Louis is one of  
the worst blots on the good name of  
an American community in our whole  
history. Illinois must bow her head  
in shame before this disgrace. We  
have no excuse. There can be no ex­  
cuse for such a break down of the  
most primitive safeguards of civil gov­  
ernment, for such betrayal of the first  
duty of ordered society.  
Will Sue for Damages.  
The National Association for the  
Advancement of Colored People, with  
former Judge Edward Osgood Brown  
of the appellate court president of the  
local chapter, is planning to institute  
suits, under the Illinois statutes against  
the city of East St. Louis and St. Clair  
county for personal damages on be­  
half of the dependents of the Negro  
men and women who died at the hands  
of the incensed mobs in the orgy of  
murder and* arson several days ago.  
Under the statutes, the dependents  
have actions against both the city and  
the county for damages to property,  
life and limb, the judgments not to ex­  
ceed $5,000 in each case. This may  
mean suits for nearly $1,000,000 when  
the final loss of the scores killed, the  
hundreds injured and the many homes  
destroyed is recorded.  
The Illinois Massacre.  
(From the Chicago Evening Post.)  
&quot;In ouah town we don&#x27;t let a nig­  
gah get off the train long enough to  
brush youah coat, not even if he&#x27;s a  
po&#x27;tah on a Pullman.&quot;  
They&#x27;ll tell you this in just these  
accents in some of the southern towns  
of Illinois.  
And it was from these towns that  
the militiamen came to &quot;maintain or­  
der in East St. Louis  
This is the whole story of the fail­  
ure of the militia in the worst race  
riot that has disgraced Illinois since  
Lovejoy was martyred.  
Troops from Northern Illinois should  
have been sent into East St. Louis  
troops from Southern Illinois should  
not have been sent there. For the twi­  
light zone of the Mason and Dixon  
line cuts across the central and south­  
ern portions of the state.  
Greatest Disgrace to~State.  
&quot;I feel very strongly on the sub-  
ject,&quot; said Judge Brown today. &quot;In my  
opinion it is the greatest disgrace upon  
the name of the state of Illinois yet  
recorded. I&#x27;m very indignant. Our or­  
ganization is watching the proceed­  
ings there, but we are waiting for the  
reports of the various investigations.  
I do not want to appear to criticize  
any one at this time. We have faith

Dr. Charles El Bentley, dentist at 25  
East Washington street. &quot;The stat­  
utes are clear on the subject. We will  
go after the sheriff also if the facts  
prove our beliefs.  
&quot;We are so astonished we can

THE MAN WH O DARES  
In the opinion of THE APPEAL,  
the strongest article denouncing the  
East Saint Louis massacre was  
anE.  
editorial published in the Christian  
Register of Boston, Mass. The Regis­  
ter is the leading Unitarian paper pub­  
lished in the United States and per­  
haps that accounts tfor the article.  
The Unitarian church is one of the  
few Christian denominations in Amer­  
ica in which there is no color line.  
The orthodox Christian sects in Amer­  
ica are so filled withprejudice that  
the ruthless massacre of helpless men,  
women and children fails to bring out  
a protest.  
The article from the Christian Reg­  
ister, which follows, is not so long as  
some of the articles which have ap­  
peared in the daily papers, but it  
isties  
evidently the most sincere which THE  
APPEAL has seen:  
The hideous outrage against law  
and humanity in East St. Louis, 111.,  
makes us turn again from the barbari­  
ties of war to the ferocities of peace,  
from crimes against civilization abroad  
to crimes against civilization at home.  
The testimony of eye witnesses shows  
that nothing is to be learned among  
white people ojf this city from the cru­  
elties and brutalities of foreign con­  
quest. No tribes of any name or time  
have ever outdone the white men and  
women who burned colored men,  
women and children the other day in  
this American city. Nothing more re­  
volting was ever charged against Ne­  
groes than was done by these white  
I honor the man who in the consci­  
entious discharge of his duty&#x27; dares to  
stand alone the world, with ignorant,  
intolerant judgment, may condemn,  
the countenances of relatives may be  
averted, and the hearts of friends grow  
cold, but the sense of duty done shall  
be sweeter than the applause of th

Ashamed to Register From East

(ChicagQ Daily Ameri^n.)  
W. R. Neal is .manager of. a hotel  
in East St, Louis, 111. Today when  
he registered at the Congress Hotel

&quot;I&#x27;m ashamed to say I came from&#x27;

Disgrace on Lincoln&#x27;s State.  
(From the Chicago Daily News.)  
Mob frenzy displayed in some of its  
most dreadful forms-in East St. Louis  
yesterday has brought disgrace and  
reproach upon the state of Abra­  
ham Lincoln.  
The Most Disgraceful Outbreak.  
(From the Chicago Journal.).  
The East St. Louis affair is the most  
disastrous and disgraceful outbreak  
the state has known for a generation  
perhaps the worst it has ever known.  
That it should come during the heat  
of a foreign war and on the eve of  
Independence Day makes it still more  
ominous.  
The Law Itself on Trial.  
(From the Chicago Herald.)  
East St. Louis, 111., the law itself,  
are all oh trial until this grim, terrible  
business is settled and settled rightly  
Failure of justice means a vicious  
precedent that will plague &quot;the* eonv I  
monwealth for years to come. When ^f  
the issue 6f law or anarchy is pre­  
sented as plainly as in the orgy at!  
East  
&quot;f  
St. Louis there should be but  
one answer.  
The Shame of Illinois.  
(From the Chicago Tribune.)  
The riot at East St. Louis is one of  
the worst blots on the good name of  
an American community in our whole  
history. Illinois must bow her head  
in shame before this disgrace. We I  
have no excuse. There can be no ex-1race  
cuse for such a break down of the I  
most primitive safeguards of civil gov-I  
ernment, for such betrayal of thefirst  
duty of ordered society.  
Will Sue for Damages.  
The National Association for the  
of Colored People, with  
former Judge Edward Osgood Brown  
of the appellate court president of the  
local chapter, is* planning to institute  
suits under the Illinois statutes against  
the city of East St. Louis and St. Clair  
county for personal damages on be­  
half of the dependents of the Negro  
men and women who died at the hands  
of the incensed mobs in the orgy of  
murder and arson several days ago.  
Under the statutes, the dependents  
have actions against both the city and  
county for damages to property,  
life and limb, the judgments not to ex­  
ceed $5,000 in each case. This may  
mean suits for nearly $1,000,000 when  
the final loss of the scores killed, the  
hundreds injured and the many homes  
destroyed is recorded.

-CRIME AGAINST CIVILIZATION.  
In thie opinion of THE APPEAL,  
the strongest article denouncing the  
East Saint Louis massacre was an  
editorial published in the Christian  
Register of Boston, Mass. The Regis­  
ter is the leading Unitarian paper pub­  
lished in the United States and per­  
haps that accounts for the article.  
The Unitarian church is one of the  
few Christian denominations in Amer­  
ica in which there is no color line.  
The orthodox Christian sects in Amer­  
ica are so filled with prejudice that  
the ruthless massacre of helpless men,  
women^and children fails to bring out  
a protest.  
The article from the Christian Reg-  
ister, which follows, is not so long as  
some of the articles which have ap­  
peared in the dally papers, but it is  
evidently the most sincere which THE  
APPEAL has seen:  
The hideous outrage against law  
and humanity in East St. Louis, 111.,  
makes us turn again from the barbari­  
ties of war to the ferocities of peace,  
from crimes against civilization abroad  
to crimes against civilization at home.  
The testimony of eye witnesses shows  
that nothing is to be learned among  
white people of this city from the cru­  
elties and brutalities of foreign con­  
quest. No tribes of any name or time  
have ever outdone the white men and  
women who burned colored men,  
women and children the other day in  
this American city. Nothing more re­  
volting was ever charged against Ne­  
groes than was done by these white  
people. The organization of the man­  
hood of the nation for the protection  
of human life and liberty on the seas  
and for the deliverance of democracy  
in the world will be needed at home  
after its task abroad is done. While  
our fellow-creatures? in the United  
States are hunted a^d tortured as if  
they were wild beasts, government can  
scarcely be called democratic. So long  
as colored people are proscribed, dis­  
criminated against, segregated and  
despised, ill-will and antipathy will  
furnish fertilizers of hatred and mur­  
der.
