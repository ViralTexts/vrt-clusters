Wilmington, N. C. Nov. 10. -This has been a turbulent day in Wilmington.  
Race war and revolution have held carnival. Early this morning a body of  
fully 1,000 representative white men destroyed the office, building, and  
plant of the negro daily newspaperm. the *Record*, and would have  
lynched the editor had he not previously left the city. A few hours  
later a fight arose between white guards by whom every block inhabited  
by white people was being patrolled, and a mob of several hundred  
negroes. Pandemonium reigned. Six negroes were killed and twenty  
wounded. The Mayor, S. P. Wright, Chief of Police J. C. Melton and the  
Board of Alderman, a fusion-negro r√©gime, became terrorized and  
resigned. Under the direction of a Citizens&#x27; Committee successors were  
elected, so that now ex-Congressmen A. M. Waddell is Mayor. Edgar C.  
Parmalee Chief of Police, and a new Board of Aldermen has assumed the  
reins of government.  
  
Peace and order have been restored, and five hundred special policemen  
many mounted and on bicycles are patrolling the streets. About five  
hundred armed citizens and militia from Fayetteville, Kingston,  
Goldsboro and else-where are here to help maintain order. The committee  
of twenty-five representing the massmeeting of white citizens in the  
execution of the provisions of the resolutions adopted yesterday,  
demanding the departure of Editor Mainly from the city and the removal  
of the *Record* plant, were to have received a definite answer to their  
demands from representative negroes at 7 A. M, to-day. Chairman A. M.  
Wadell was to report in front of the Wilmington Light Infantry armory at  
8 o&#x27;clock. At the appointed hour more than five hundred determined white  
citizens, merchants, lawyers, preachers, doctors, well armed with guns  
and revolvers, gathered at the armory. And Col. Waddell reported that he  
had received no answer from the negroes. They waited at the armory until  
almost 9 o&#x27;clock hoping that an answer complying with their demands  
would be received, but none came.  
  
The men formed in line, four abreast, and started on the march to the  
*Record* office, in a thickly populated negro settlement. As the long  
column of armed men approached the neighborhood a throng of negroes, men  
women, and children, began to flee in frenzy. Very soon scarcely one was  
in sight anywhere. When the column reached the building, a two-story  
frame structure, the men were halted, and several advanced to the door.  
It was locked.  
  
A few blows by stalwart men forced it open, and about twenty citizens  
entered, and within a few minutes the whole plant was wrecked and the  
broken pieces pitched into the street. The windows of the house were  
broken out. As the numerous fragments were tossed into the street and  
the people recognized what they were exultant shouts wnet up. It was a  
long sign, &quot;The Record Publication Company,&quot; was cast into the stree  
that the greatest outburst of cheers went up. A beaver hat was thrown  
out and quickly torn in pieces, as was a life bust cray on likeness of  
Editor Manly.  
  
BUILDING SET ON FIRE.  
  
When the wrecking was about complete, it became evident that the  
building was on fire. Smoke was pouring out of the upper windows. There  
were shouts of indignation and commands to extinguish the flames, but  
the fire spread quickly, so that the Fire Department had to be called  
out. As the engines and hose reels dashed up several rounds of shot were  
fired by the men who were lined up for more than two squares either way.  
The department quickly had the fire under control, but not before the  
building was a total wreck. The spread of the flames to adjacent  
buildings was prevented.  
  
Conservative men very much regret the fire, not only because it was  
entirely unneccesarry, but endangered a great deal of other property as  
well. Close on one side of the building was St. Stephen&#x27;s Church, the  
largest and handsomest negro church in the city. On the other side with  
only three or four small cottages joined close together, between it and  
the burning buildings is Ruth Hall, a large and well equipped hall, and  
used by negroes. Not one of the adjacent buildings was injured.  
  
As soon it was apparent that the fire was under control the people left  
the scene and dispersed through the city, many of them going on guard  
duty on the various blocks. All was quiet until wild rumors, with no  
foundation in fact, were carried of the negroes. More than 500 were at  
work in the cotton compress. They were told that their homes were being  
burned. They rushed pell-mell from their work. However, by the efforts  
of Messrs. James and W. H. Sprunt, the proprietors of the Alexander  
Sprunt &amp; Co. plant. the great majority were stopped and finally  
controlled. They left for their homes in small squads.  
  
SHOOTING BEGINS.  
  
About the time the negroes were calmed news came from the First ward  
over the railroad that a riot was in progress there. Large numbers of  
white men boarded the street cars or went on foot to the scene, corner  
Fourth and Harnett streets.  
  
This was about 11:30 o&#x27;clock. When they reached the scene six negroes  
had already been killed and fully twenty wounded. One young white man,  
William Mayo, was wounded seriously, and wo others, George Piner and a  
Mr. Chadwick, were slightly wounded.  
  
What gave rise to the trouble was that white guards who were on duty on  
the corner of Fourth and Harnett streets halted a number of negroes who  
showed a threatening manner. All of them save one heeded the advice of  
the guards to go away. He finally turned as though to move away, and he  
suddenly wheeled about and fired at the guards. Very quickly several  
rifle balls crashed through his body, killling him instantly. The ball  
fired by the negro took effect in William Piner&#x27;s arm, Negroes in sight  
quickly darted around corners, and in a few minutes one of them rose&#x27;up  
from behind a fence and fired a rifle seriously wounding William Mayo,  
now of Yonkers, N. Y.. who was standing on the plazza of his father&#x27;s  
residence. Mr. Mayo was here to vote and would have returned home in a  
few days. The negro was captured. He was in his own yard. Two rifles  
were found in his house.  
  
A large mob of negroes assembled about a square away and reinforcements  
for the white men having arrived, a volley was fired upon them killing  
four and wounding others. The negroes quickly retreated.  
  
The Wilmington Light Infantry and the naval reserves were called out,  
and the rapid-fire gun and Hotchkiss one pounder were also hurried to  
the scene. A mob of several hundred negroes was gathered on Ninth  
street, corner of Nixon, but as the military advanced the negroes fell  
back and scattered,  
  
When near Sixth and Nixon a shot was fired into naval reserves from a  
negro house. A volley of bullets was fired by the military through doors  
and windows, killing one negro. Six more inmates were camptured and  
escored to jail. The house was demolished.  
  
With the exception of two or three casualties in remote parts of the  
city, this ended the rioting scenes of the day.  
  
The news of the conflict spread quickly to neighboring cities, and large  
bodies of men arrived during the afternoon from Fayetville and near-by  
towns. All parts of the city inhabited by white people are guarded  
closely tonight.  
  
It is learned to-night that the negro who shot Mayo was found secreted  
in the house. He was taken out and told to run for his life. He started  
off, but only advanced a few yards before his body was riddled with  
bullets.  
  
A negro named Tom Miller, and a white man, both of whom had taken a  
prominent part in inciting the negroes to riot, were sought for and  
placed in jail. Five other negroes were also incarcerrated, and several  
banished from the city.  
  
The negro policemen who are attached to the &quot;force&quot; under the old regime  
failed to report for duty to-night.  
  
A white Republican who has been an energetic negro leader had peremptory  
noties to leave the city, which he did after promising never to return.  
A large numer of firearms were captured to-day from the negroes.

Race Riots and Shotgun Law in the Carolinas  
  
Wilmington. N. C. Nov. 19. - The Governor of South Carolina, he says to  
the Governor of North Carolina, &quot;It&#x27;s along time between lunchings&quot;: and  
the Governor of North Carolina he says to the Governor of South  
Carolina, &quot;Sh-h! Don&#x27;t talk to me about lynchigs. Golly! Don&#x27;t you know  
they came near lynching me the other night?&quot;  
  
Thus in allegory they are telling through this Southern country of an  
incident in the race war of last week which somehow did not get into the  
papers, but came very near furnishing as big a sensation as North  
Carolina ever had in its history. So far as recalled no Governor of a  
State in this country has ever lost his life at the hands of indignant  
citizens of his commonwealth.  
  
But Governor Daniel L. Russell of North Carolina came very near  
suffering it from mob rule when the excitement was at its height and  
while the streets of Wilmington were literally running with blood.  
  
Governor Russell began his political career as a leader in this section  
of the State. He organized the colored Republicans in Wilimington and  
more than any other one man is responsible for the ascendency of the  
African over the white man in the Cape Fear region. So when the negroes  
were shooting at the white citizens and the white citizens were actually  
potting the negroes by dozens with Winchesters, Springfields and  
shotguns, the Governor, who was in this section of North Carolina,  
hearing of the trouble, started for home.  
  
&quot;LYNCH THE GOVERNOR.&quot;  
  
He first intended going by way of Goldsboro. Learning that there was a  
mob of several hundred men at Goldsboro waiting to give him a reception,  
and knowing that at that period of excitement he was a marked man, he  
changed his route and went via Maxton. Word got to Maxton ahead of the  
Governor that he was going that way, and when the train arrived a  
swearing, howling mob of &quot;red shirts,&quot; heavily armed and ready for  
almost anything, was awaiting him.  
  
They invaded the car, threatened the Governor and actually offered him  
violence. The crowd was increasing and there were cries of &quot;Lynch him!&quot;  
when the Governor and one of his friends hustled out of the car into a  
box car, which was locked behind him, and the conductor and his friends  
stood guard until the train pulled out.  
  
Governor Russell reached his home, in Raleigh, over the Seaboard Air  
Line, very badly frightened, and the Governor&#x27;s friend did not have a  
button on his coat and his raiment was in tatters. The Governor weighs  
more than 300 pounds and his frustrated enemies at Maxton are still  
speculating as to the figure he would have cut at the end of a rope.  
  
This is only one incident of the many exciting events that have stirred  
the two Carolinas during the last ten days.  
  
There has been a great political riot and a wholesale massacre of  
negroes in Wilmington, N. C. There has been a great political riot and a  
wholesale massacre of negroes in Greenwood, S. C. The story of  
Wilmington and the story of Greenwood both furnish food for thought, but  
on far different lines.  
  
THE WILMINGTON RIOT.  
  
At Wilmington at least fifteen negroes were killed, but no white man  
lost his life. At Greenwood at least eight negroes were kileld and one  
white man lost his life.  
  
I will first tell the story of Wilmington and then of Greenwood, and let  
the impartial reader draw his own conclusions and make his own  
comparisons.  
  
The Wilmington riot was due entirely to the negro attaining supremacy in  
local politics. North Carolina is about the only Southern State in which  
the negro has practically without restriction exercised the right of  
suffrage. The negroes have been permitted to do this because they were  
in the minority. There are 210,000 white voters in the State and only  
about 100,000 colored voters. Only in recent years did the danger of the  
negro securing supremacy become threatening. In 1898, when a combination  
of the black and white Republicans and the Populists made Russell  
Governor by an enormous majority, the white voters, and especially the  
Democratic white voters, began to have their apprehensions.  
  
Governor Russell hails from the section of the State in which Wilmington  
is situated. Here the ratio of colored men to white is almost two to  
one. The Governor and his Republican allies got hold of the government  
of the city of Wilmington, and in order to keep the negroes solid  
permitted them to share in the offices. The colored men here quickly  
felt their power. They realized that it was through their votes that the  
Republicans had triumphed. While the Republican leaders held the more  
important offices the white men in Wilmington soon found that they had  
over them a colored police force, white the fire department largely  
consisted of colored men and the last post office was manned with  
colored letter-carriers.  
  
A NEGRO GOVERNMENT.  
  
In fact, to all intents and purposes, it was a colored city government.  
The colored city government levied the city taxes, collected them and  
spent them. The whites were paying 96 ¬Ω per cent of the taxes, the  
colored were paying 3 ¬Ω per cent of the taxes.  
  
Following the induction into office of this new regime came a repetition  
of the old story of profligacy and an abuse of power. Nearly every  
Southern city in the days of reconstruction had been through it, and now  
it was Wilmington&#x27;s turn. The colored men did not make good policemen.  
They neglected their posts and robberies multiplied. Women were insulted  
on the street and there was no redress. White women could be jostled  
from the sidewalks into the muddy streets by colored women and negro men  
would laugh at them. Little white girls would have their hats snatched  
and thrown into the roadway and assaults of negroes upon whites were of  
constant occurrence. Property was insecure and insurance rates advanced.  
  
Even Mr. Chadbourn, the Republican Postmaster, wrote and published a  
letter, in which he declared that the negroes were in charge of the  
municipal government of Wilmington; that the whites would not longer  
fear with this condition of affairs, and that &quot;they would carry the next  
election either with votes or with arms.&quot;  
  
Long before the canvass in the campaign just closed began the white  
citizens of Wilmington, almost without regard to party, prepared for the  
greatest emergency. Six months ago they began to arm themselves quietly.  
Each white citizen not affiliated with the Republican reign, if he did  
not already have a serviceable firearm, purchased a Winchester or a  
Springfield rifle, and lots of ammunition. They determined to carry the  
fall election by force and intimidation if they could not carry it any  
other way.  
  
GOVERNOR RUSSELL ALARMED.  
  
They made no concealment of this determination before the election; they  
make no concealment of it now. They were firmly convinced that the  
African was not born to rule the white man, and no amount of argument  
can change their opinion.  
  
Governor Russell became alarmed at the threatening condition of affairs  
that his management had brought about. He was notified that something  
dreadful would happen in Wilmington if the negroes attempted to outvote  
the whites on election day, and through his influence the Republican  
leaders were forced, just before the election, to take down their ticket  
and give the Democrats no opposition in the county except one  
Representative in Congress and State Senator, these districts including  
other counties than New Hanover, in which Wilmington is situated.  
  
Election day passed off quietly in Wilmington, although in three or four  
other counties in the State the negroes were intimidated an hindered  
from voting by the presence of armed men at the polls.  
  
The election being over the whites determined to put out of office the  
entire city government, by force if necessary. The Governor tried to  
induce the city officials to resign, but without avail. Then an orderly  
meeting of the white citizens was called, and resolutions of the city  
government in the interest of the white population, calling on Alexander  
Manly, the colored editor of the Republican paper, to leave town, and  
appointing a committee to wait on the more objectionable white  
officeholders and colored leaders and invite them to leave the county.  
  
WHITE MAN KILLED FIRST.  
  
The story of the exciting events that followed this revolution have  
already been told. Manly, the colored editor, who had been an object of  
loathing for months because of the editorial attacking white women, had  
already taken his departure. The Record office was burned, because the  
proprietors of the paper were believed by the committee appointed at the  
mass meeting to be ignoring its demand.  
  
An outbreak on the part of the negroes had been expected that day, and  
nearly every white man in the city of Wilmington was under arms. This  
has been estimated at 2000. The white citizens of each block had a  
distinct organization under a separate leader. Each man had his orders,  
and no matter where disorder broke out the white citizens were prepared  
to quell it quickly or add to it materially.  
  
There is no question that the first shooting was done by the black men.  
A negro in Brooklyn, a suburb, shot a white man through the right arm.  
The wounded man with his left hand shot the negro dead. The negroes  
began to rally in force with guns, and four of them were shot dead in  
their tracks then and there. The blacks were overawed, but not before at  
least fifteen had been killed and probably twice as many wounded. One  
negro was founded badly wounded hiding beneath a porch and was taken to  
a hospital.  
  
It was reign of terror simply for the blacks and their white associates.  
  
A REIGN OF TERROR  
  
A committee moved quickly around and notified the more prominent and  
objectionable white Republicans that they must leave town. Silas P.  
Wright, the Mayor, had already gone. Justice of the Peace Bunting, who  
was also United States Comissioner, was told to go. So were Chief of  
Police Melton and Charles Gilbert, the superintendent of city carts.  
Notice was also served on G. Z. French. Mr. French is the acting  
sheriff. He allowed the actual Sheriff \$1200 salary, and performed all  
the duties of the office himself and took all the emoluments.  
  
Pictures of Bunting and his colored housekeeper still hang on a tree  
infront of his house, where they were hung by the mob. Thomas Miller, a  
noted colored leader, who, when he heard the Record building had been  
burned, declare that he would wash his hands in white man&#x27;s blood that  
night, was lodged in jail, and a picket was thrown around to prevent the  
more irresponsible whites from dragging him forth and killing him.  
  
Colonel Waddell, one of the most prominent citizens, who had been  
chairman of the mass meeting, was elected Mayor, and all the old  
officials resigned under pressure. Waddell has a fighter&#x27;s jaw. His  
ancestors have fought in three wars.  
  
Dr. Silas P. Wright offered his resignation as Mayor of the city, and it  
was accepted. Colonel A. M. Waddell was elected Mayor of the city and  
sworn in by M. W. Newman. J. P., whereupon Mr. Waddell took his seat as  
Mayor.  
  
Nearly all of the old city officials are now in Washington seeking to  
have a Congressional investigation or are wandering northward seeking  
new places of abode.  
  
The statement telegraphed North that ministers of the Gospel, with  
rifles on their shoulders, paraded the streets on Thursday and Friday  
nights to preserve order is no fiction. This actually took place. It is  
also a fact that the race question in Wilmington rose above politics,  
and that many white men heretofore Republicans joined in overturning the  
city government.  
  
The fury of the mob at Wilmington when it finally burst forth was added  
to by race prejudice, long kept in restraint in North Carolina. The  
deepest blot on the city is that the poor whites wantonly shot any  
negroes they met. Most of the murdered victims were unarmed and  
molesting no one.  
  
So high did the feeling in Wilmington run during the political campaign  
that it is a marvel that there was not a murderous outbreak long before  
Thursday, November 10.  
  
Early in the campaign Governor Russell became a target for the orators  
of the white man&#x27;s party. The Governor owns a large plantation on the  
other side of Cape Fear River, just opposite Wilmington. For years he  
has supplied the city with milk. Some one printed a communication in the  
Messenger one day inquiring why white men brought Governor Russell&#x27;s  
milk, since he was responsible for negro rule in the city.  
  
Instantly the Governor&#x27;s dairy was boycotted and his milk is not now  
sold in the city.  
  
So much for the story of the riot in Wilmington. Now for the story of  
Greenwood

m Washington says:  
  
Ever since Governor Russell&#x27;s visit here there have been rumors current  
in the inner North Carolina circle that a deal is on foot whereby Ewart  
is to be defeated in the senate for judge of the western district,  
Senator Pritchard to be appointed in his place and V.S. Lusk to be named  
as senator by Governor Russell to succeed Pritchard. This same rumor was  
current last winter, but proved to be at that time unfounded. It appears  
now with a semblance of substance at least to it, but whether it is well  
founded future developments alone can determine.  
  
It is certain now that Governor Russell is opposed to the confirmation  
of Judge Ewart. He covered his tracks so well while here that at first  
he was believed to have interested himself in Ewart&#x27;s behalf. Senator  
Pritchard was led to so believe, but after the governor&#x27;s departure, he  
became possessed of information to the contrary. Senator Pritchard still  
favors Ewart, but the best legal minds in the senate are opposed to him  
and Senator Butler will leave no stone unturned to defeat him. It is  
well known here that Pritchard would not decline a life position such as  
is the place of judge of the western district of North Carolina.At the  
same time. Pritchard does not wish to be placed in a position of being  
even by inference, opposed to Ewart, and he frowns upon all suggestions  
in that direction. Yet if Ewart if defeated Pritchard&#x27;s is the name that  
is likely to occur to the president as an acceptable one. It is said  
that Governor Russell suggested him to the president.  
  
Then too Pritchard would meet with almost instant confirmation.  
Senatorial courtesy alone would insure that. It is also pointed out that  
in the next senate, with a heavy republican majority, Pritchard&#x27;s vote  
would not be needed by the republicans. Butler would not oppose  
Pritchard. In fact they have of late been getting closer together than  
heretofore. Pritchard&#x27;s days, democrats assert are numbered in North  
Carolina, and beyond his present term as senator he would have no  
political future. As judge he would have a life position. Then too, it  
is said that Butler would angle for Pritchard&#x27;s help, in consideration  
of Butler&#x27;s allowing Pritchard&#x27;s confirmation. This would leave the road  
clear for Russell to reward Mr. Lusk, a friend of Pritchard as well as  
himself, by appointing him senator. All this suggests the formation of a  
Pritchard-Butler-Russell combine, and the ground indications, at  
present, look that way.  
  
ALL LOOKS TO SIMMONS.  
  
Among democrats here no other name is heard as the next senator from  
North Carolina except that of Chairman Simmons. His record while in  
congress was excellent, and among the older members, both of the house  
and the senate, he is remembered most pleasantly. It is not believed  
among democrats that any combination can be found among the  
populist-republicans that can prevent the democrats from controlling the  
next legislature.  
  
WILMINGTON RIOT CASES.  
  
The department of justice does not seem to be concerning itself much  
over the Wilmington riot cases. The direct prosecution of these cases  
has been placed in the hands of District Attorney Bernard. Regarding the  
detail of witnesses summoned before the grand jury, etc., the department  
of justice professes ignorance.  
  
&quot;The presumption is that officials will do their duty, is it not?&quot;  
suggested The Post correspondent to Assistant Attorney General Boyd,  
referring to the failure of Mr Bernard to have essential witnesses  
before the Raleigh grand jury.  
  
&quot;That is the presumption,&quot; he said, &quot;but sometimes it is a violent one.\
Mr. Boyd said that so far as he knew no letter from Judge Purnell, &quot;tart  
or otherwise,&quot; regarding the Wilmington affair, had been recieved by the  
department of justice.  
  
Bunting and Melton are all here and have been for ten days or more. They  
could easily be reached. Mr Benard evidently believes with Congressman  
Kitchin, that his efforts tog et indictments in the Wilmington case  
would be unavailing. Said Kitchin: &quot;No grand jury that can be assembled  
in our state will return indictments against any one in the Wilmington  
affair.&quot;  
  
Congressman Strowd has not been here this session.  
  
White, the negro congressman, appeared in his seat yesterday for the  
first time.  
  
Only Kitchin and White of the North Carolina delegation were present  
when the house adjourned Wednesday for the Christmas holidays, all the  
others having left the day before for home.  
  
September 15, 1899, &quot;[[Look Blue for  
Bernard]{.underline}](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn92073953/1899-09-15/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1898&amp;index=2&amp;rows=20&amp;words=riot+Wilmington&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1899&amp;proxtext=Wilmington+Riot&amp;y=19&amp;x=21&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1)&quot;  
The Wilson Times(Wilson, North Carolina)  
  
J. Romero  
  
Washington, Sept.- At the Department of Justice officials are  
judiciously reticent about the most recent escapade of District Attorney  
Bernard. None will be quoted, and the Attorney General is naturally  
indignant that a high official of his department, who is sworn to uphold  
the laws, should be charged with bringing the department into disgrace  
as well as himself. Marked copies of The Morning Post containing an  
account of Mr. Shepard at Greenville have been sent to the  
Attorney-General, and the general feeling is that of disgust and shame.  
  
As stated in these dispatches several times, the attorney for the  
Eastern District of North Carolina does not stand very high at the  
Department of Justice, and his official tenure has long hung by a  
thread. He would have been fired long ago when his loose methods of  
conducting business was the subject of official inquiry, had not Senator  
Pritchard put in his saving oar. Again, his jellyfish conduct of the  
case against the Wilmington &quot;rioters,&quot; so called, showed an utter lack  
of bone in the back.  
  
What the present course of the powers that be, will be towards Mr.  
Benard cannot be definitely asserted. It is certain, however, that he  
will have to receive backing and support outside of Senator Pritchard  
who will not uphold the invasion of the home circle even by one whose  
appointment he secured he is not that kind of a man.

From the Shores of the Pacific  
  
After recounting the conditions antecedent to the 10th of November, the  
Oregonian of Portland, Oregon speaks sensibly as follows:  
  
The recital of the facts of this anti negro crusade in North Carolina is  
essential to full understanding of the situation, and to fair  
consideration of the appeal made by our colored people and by some of  
the leading republican newspapers of the east for the interference of  
the president. In our judgement, nothing can be done to relieve the  
situation of the south through invoking the interference of the federal  
government. The governor of North Carolina is a republican elected by  
the vote of the negroes; he did not interfere; he made no call upon the  
president. The governor of South Carolina did not interfere nor make any  
call for federal interference. Under their state governments, these  
revolutionists and rioters will not be punished; it does not appear that  
in the overthrow of the municipal government at Wilmington, or in the  
race riot at Greenwood, any federal law was attacked or obstructed, or  
any United States official swerve resisted in the exercise of their  
duties.  
  
The president would probably find it difficult to obtain legal ground  
for interference, but, even if he could interfere legally in the  
municipal election, like that at Wilmington, he could not interfere  
effectively. It was a republican congress that refused to give Grant a  
force in 1874, without which he confessed he could not interfere  
effectively to suppress such outrages as those in the Carolinas. If the  
ruling forces of the public opinion in North Carolina are so strongly  
white that a republican governor elected largely by negro votes dares  
not interfere; if, as we have proved over and over again during twenty  
years, no local juries will convict any man put on trial for acts of  
race violence, of what consequence would be the investigation of a  
federal attorney general, or the arrest and trial of the leading  
rioters? When we had the south under bayonet rule, it was not easy to  
identify, try and convict a kuklux assassin, and since the end of  
bayonet rule it has been impossible.  
  
The situation at the south is deplorable, but it is, we believe,  
incurable through any outside interference. If there was any danger that  
President McKinley could or would interfere to upset the uprising  
municipal government of Wilmington tomorrow, there would be a civil war.  
The Columbia, (S. C.) State Journal says that, if the North Carolina  
negroes should &quot;force a war, the whites of South Carolina would cross  
the line to help their white brethren.&quot; The Richmond Times adds that the  
Virgnia whites would do the same for &quot;blood is thicker than water.&quot; A  
mob assaulted and nearly killed a negro in the Northfolk, Va.,  
postoffice who called for mail for &quot;Editor Manly.&quot; whose paper was  
destroyed in the Wilmington Riot.  
  
The situation at the south is one that must be met as a condition as  
best we can. It cannot be solved by the theoretical expectation of equal  
legal justice which is generally enforced and obtained at the north. No  
president can arrest, no government can indict, try, convict and punish  
a whole people; and that is what would be necessary to punish the acts  
of violence and revolution that have been recently been committed in the  
Carolinas and the Mississippi. Nobody can solve the negro problem;  
nobody can settle the race war at the south, if the state governments  
and the ruling forces of public opinion in these states are not equal to  
its solution. The negro must accept the best terms he can get from the  
ruling white public opinion, not because it is equal justice, but  
because he cannot help himself. President McKinely is powerless to  
interfere, and if he were not powerless his interference would only  
start a storm of resistance which could not be overcome. The whites,  
whether in the majority or not, will be sure to rule at the south, by  
right if possible, by might if necessary. What Grant could not maintain  
by bayonet rule cannot be undone or redressed by McKinely with a marshal  
and a federal judge. In localities where the negroes are few there will  
be little difficulty. But in localities where they are numerous they  
will not be permitted the exercise of political rights, for the result  
would result in negro government. The endowment of the blacks with the  
full right of suffrage was the greatest mistake ever made in our  
political history. It has only brought trouble to them and increased  
beyond measure the political difficulties of the country. Since the  
error is now seen in its results, it may as well be frankly confessed.  
It mocks the negroes with bestowal of a franchise which the masse of  
them will not be permitted to exercise, and, in fact, are unfit to  
exercise, and brings on a race war in which they will in every case be  
trodden down. Since this is the demonstrated result, there is no need to  
deceive ourselves about it. Abstention of the blacks from politics and  
in particular from combinations to elect person of their own races to  
office is necessary alike for their safety and for the public place; for  
the whites will not submit to negro government.

tured today from the negroes.  
The committee of twenty-five men, rep¬≠  
resenting the mass meeting of white cit¬≠  
izens and appointed to execute the pro¬≠  
visions of the resolutions adopted yester¬≠  
day, which demanded the departure of  
Editor Manly from the city and the re¬≠  
moval of the Record plant, was to have  
a definite answer to their demands from  
representative negroes at 7 a. m. today.  
Chairman A. -JI. Waddell was to report  
the answer to the white citizens in front  
of the Wilmington Light Infantry armory  
at S o&#x27;clock.  
Xo Answer lleceive&#x27;d.  
At the appointed hour more than BOO  
determined white citizens, including mer¬≠  
chants, lawyers, preachers and doctors,  
all well armed, gathered at the armory.  
Col. Waddell reported that he had re¬≠  
ceived no answer from the negroes. The  
crowd waited at the armory until almost  
9 o&#x27;clock, hoping that an answer comply¬≠  
ing with their demands would be received,  
but none came.  
The men then formed In line, four  
abreast, and started on the march to the  
Record office, in a thickly populated ne¬≠  
gro settlement. As the long column of  
armed men approached the vicinity many  
negroes men, women and children were  
seen fleeing.  
When the column reached the building,  
a two-story frame structure, the men  
were halted and several advanced to the  
door. It was locked. A few blows forced  
It open, and about twenty citizens enter¬≠  
ed and within a very few minutes the  
whole plant was wrecked and the broken  
pieces pitched Into the street. The win¬≠  
dows of the house were broken out. As  
the fragments were tossed into the street  
shouts went up.  
An Ontbumt of Cheer.  
It was when a long sign, &quot;The Record  
Publication. Company,&quot; was cast Into the  
street that the greatest outburst of  
cheers went up. A beaver hat was thrown  
out and quickly torn in pieces, as was  
a crayon likeness of Editor Manly.  
When the wrecking was about complete  
it became evident that the building was  
on Are. Smoke was rising out of the  
upper windows. There were shouts of In¬≠  
dignation and commands to extinguish  
the flames. But the Are spread quickly,  
so that the Are department had to be  
called out. As the engines and hose reels  
dashed upon the scene, several rounds  
were fired by the men who were lined up  
for more than two squares cither way.

prevent the spread of the flames to ad  
  
jacent buildings. Conservative men very  
much regret the fire, not only because  
it was entirely unnecessary, but endan¬≠  
gered a great deal of other property, as  
well.  
Close on one side of the building was  
St. Stephen&#x27;s Church, the largest and  
handsomest negro church In the city. On  
the other side, with only three or four  
small cottagesjoined close together, be¬≠  
tween it and the burning building, is  
Ruth Hnll, a large and well equippcJ hall  
used by negroes. As soon as It &#x27;was ap¬≠  
parent that the fire was under control,  
the people left the scene and disp?rseJ  
through the city, many of them going on  
guard duty on the arlous blocks.  
NfCroes llantcn tu the Scene.  
All was quiet until wild rumors wera  
cnrrled to the negroes. More than five  
hundred were at work In the cotton  
compress. They were told that &quot;their  
homes were being burned, etc. They  
rushed, pell-mell from their work. How¬≠  
ever, by the heroic efforts of the Messrs.  
James and W. H. Sprunt, the great ma¬≠  
jority were stopped.  
About the time they were gotten under  
control news came from the First ward,  
over the railroad, that a riot was in pro¬≠  
gress there. Largo numbers of armed  
men boarded the street cars, or went  
on foot to the scene at the corner of  
Fourth and Harnett Streets.  
Fully Twenty Wounded.  
This was about 11:30 o&#x27;clock. When  
they reached the scene four negroes had  
already been killed and fully twenty  
wounded. One young white man, William  
Mao, was seriously wounded.  
What gave rise to the trouble was that  
white guards on duty on the corner of  
Fourth and Harnett Streets had halted  
a number of negroes.  
All save one heeded the advice of the  
guards to disperse. He turned as though  
to move away, but suddenly wheeled  
about and fired at a squad of guards. Sev¬≠  
eral rifle balls went through his body,  
killing him instantly. The ball fired by  
the negro took effect In Piner&#x27;s arm.  
Negroes in sight quickly darted around  
corners and In a few minutes one of them  
raised from behind a fence and fired, se¬≠  
riously wounding William Yonkers, who  
was here to vole and would have re¬≠  
turned heme in a few days.  
Another Deadly Volley.  
The negro was captured. He was In  
his own yard and two Winchesters were  
found in his house. Within ten minutes  
he was shot to death. A large mob of ne¬≠  
groes assembled about a square away,  
and, re-enforcements for the whites hav¬≠  
ing arrived, ja volley was fired upon them,  
killing four&#x27;and wounding others. The  
negroes quickly retreated.  
The Wilmington Light Infantry and the  
nival reserves were called out and  
rapid-fire gun and Hotchkiss one-pounder  
were also hurriedly carried to the scene.  
A mob of several hundred negroes was  
gathered on Ninth Street, corner of Nix¬≠  
on, but as the military advanced the ne¬≠  
groes fell back and rapidly scampered.  
The Military Fire.  
When near Sixth and Nixon a shot was  
fired Into the naval reserves from a ne¬≠  
gro&#x27;s house. A volley of bullets was fired  
by the military through doors and win¬≠  
dows, killing one negro. Six more Inmates  
were captured and escorted to Jail. The  
house was demolished.  
With the exception of two or three cas¬≠  
ualties In remote portions of the city,  
this ended the really riotous scenes of the  
day.  
The news of the conflict spread quickly  
to neighboring cities and large bodies of  
men arrived during the afternoon from  
Fayetteville and near-by towns. All sec¬≠  
tions of the city Inhabited by white peo¬≠  
ple are closely guarded tonight.

Wilmington, Nov. lu.?This  
I has been a turbulent day indeed  
in Wilmington. Race war and  
; revolution have held high carnival.  
Early this morning a body of  
fully 1 ,000 representative white  
men destroyed the ollice buildimr  
  
and plant of the negro daily, The  
Record, and would have lynched  
the editor had if not been that  
the fellow had previously left the  
city. A few hours later a fight  
arose between white guards ? by  
whom every block inhabited by  
white people was beingputrolcd ?  
and a mob of several hundred negroes.  
Pandemonium reigned. The  
! mayor, S P Wright, Chief of  
Police J C Melton nnd the board  
j of Q aldermen a fusion-negro  
I regime, became terrorized and  
resigned under the direction of a

A committee of 25 citizens was ap¬≠  
pointed to direct the execution of the  
provisions of the resolutions.  
NEWSPAPER OFFICE SACKED.  
A General Fight in Which Ten Ne¬≠  
groes Are Killed.  
The committee of 25 men represent¬≠  
ing the mass meeting of white citizens  
in the execution of the provisions of  
the resolutions adopted Wednesday, de¬≠  
manding the departure of Editor Manly  
from the city and the removal of The  
Record plant, were to have received a  
definite answer to their demands from  
representative -Negroes at 7.30 a. mn.,  
Thursday morning. Chairman A. M.  
Waddell was to epnort the nswer tonthe  
  
white citizens in front of the Wil¬≠  
mington Light infantry armory at 8  
o&#x27;clock.  
At the appointed hour more than 500  
determined white citizens, consisting  
of merchants, lawyers, preachers, doc¬≠  
tors, etc., well armed with guns and  
ievolvers, gathered at the armory, and  
Col. Waddell reported that he had re¬≠  
ceived no answer from the negroes.  
They waited at the armory until almost  
9 o&#x27;clock, hoping that an answer com¬≠  
plying with their demands would be re¬≠  
ceived, but none came. The men then  
formed in line, four abreast, and started  
on the march to the Record office, in a  
thickly populated negro settlement. As  
the long column of armed men approach  
ed the vicinity great crowds of Negroes,  
men, women and children, were fleeing  
this way and that in a perfect frenzy,  
and very soon, scarcely one was in sight  
anywhere. When the column reached  
the building, a two-story frame struc¬≠  
ture, the men were halted, and several  
advanced to the door. It was locked.  
A few blows by stalwart men forced it  
open, about 20 citizens entered, and  
within a very few minutes the whole  
plant was wrecked, and the broken  
pieces pitched into the street. The  
windows of the house were broken out.  
As the numerous fragments were tossed  
into the street, and the people recog¬≠  
nized what they were, exultant shouts  
went up. Yet with it all there was a  
remarkable demonstration of coolness  
and determination. It was when a  
long sign, &quot;The Record Publishing  
Co.,&quot; was cast into the street, that the  
greatest outburst of cheers went up. A  
beaver hat was thrown out and quickly  
torn in pieces, as was a life bust crayon  
likeness of editor Manly. When the  
wrecking was about complete it became  
evident that the building was on fire.  
Smoke was rising out of the upper  
windows. There were shouts of indig¬≠  
natioD and commands to extinguish the  
flames. But the fire spread quickly, so  
that the fire department had to be call¬≠  
ed out. As the engines and hose reels  
dashed upon the scene, several rounds  
were fired by the men who were lined  
up for inore than two squares either  
way. The department quickly had the  
fire under contrui-out not before the  
building was a total wreck-and pre¬≠  
vented the spread of the iamus to adja¬≠  
cent buildings, Conservative men very  
much regret the fire, not only because  
it was entirely unnecessary, bat because  
it endangered a great deal of other pro¬≠  
perty as well. Close on one side of the  
building was St. Stephen&#x27;s church, the  
largest and hand-omest Negro church  
in the city. On the other side, with  
only three or four small cottages, join¬≠  
ed closely together, between it and the  
burning building is Ruth hall, a &#x27;large  
and well equipped hall owned and used  
by Negroes. Happily not a single one  
of the adjacent buildings were injured.  
As soon as it was apparent that the fire  
was under control, the people left the  
scene and dispersed through the city,  
many of them going on guard duty on  
their various blocks.  
All was quiet until wild rumors, with  
no foundation in fact, were carried to  
the Negroes, more than 500, a- work in  
the cotton compress. They were told  
that their homes were being burned,  
etc. They rushed pell mell from their  
work. However, by the heroic efforts  
of Messrs. James and. W. H. Sprunt,  
the proprietors of Alexander Sprunt &amp;  
Sons Co., the great majority of them  
were stopped, and finally so controlled&#x27;  
as to leave for their home in small  
squads.  
About the time the trouble at the  
compress was gotten under control,  
news came from the first ward, over  
the railroad, that a riot was in progress  
there. Large numbers of armed men  
boarded the street car or ran on foot to  
the scene, corner of Fourth and Harnett  
streets.  
This was about 11:30 o&#x27;clock. When  
they reached the scene five Negroes had  
already been killed and fully 20 wound¬≠  
ed; one highly esteemed young white  
man, Mr. William Mayo, was seriously  
wounded and two others, George Piaser  
and a Mr. Chadwick, were slightly  
wounded.  
What gave rise to the trouble was  
that white guards who-were on duty  
on the corner of Fourth and Harnett  
streets, halted a squad of Negroes who  
manifested a threatening air. All of  
them save one heeded the advice of  
the guards to disperse. He finally  
turned as though to move away and  
suddenly wheeled about and fired at the  
squad of guards. Very quickly several  
rifle balls crashed through his body,  
killing him instantly. The ball fired  
by the Negro took effect in Win. Piner&#x27;s  
arm. The Negroes in sight quickly  
darted around corners, and in a few mo¬≠  
meats one of them raised up from be¬≠  
hind a fence anid fired a Winchester  
rifle, severely wounding Win. Mayo,  
now of Yonkers, N. Y., who was stand¬≠  
ing on the piazza of his father&#x27;s resi¬≠  
dence. Mr. Mayo was here to vote and  
would have returned home in a few  
days. The Negro was captured. lie  
was in his own yard and two Winches¬≠  
ters were found in his house. Within  
10 minutes his body was riddled with  
bullets. A large mob of Negroes as¬≠  
sembled about a square away, and rein¬≠  
forcements for the white men having  
arrived a volley was fired upon them  
killing four more and wounding others.  
The Negroes quickly retreated. The  
Wilmingfn Light infantry and the  
naval. reserves were called out and the  
rapid-fire gun and the Hotchkiss one¬≠  
pounder were also hurriedly carried to  
the scene. A mob of several hundred  
Negroes was gathered on Ninth street,  
corner of Nixon, but as the military ad¬≠  
vanced the Negroes fell back and rapid¬≠  
ly scattered.  
When near Sixth and Nixon streets a  
shot was fired into the naval reserves  
from a Negro house. A-volley of bul¬≠  
lets was fired by the military through  
doors and windows, killing one Negro.  
Nine inmates were captured arnd es¬≠  
corted to jail. The house was &#x27;emol¬≠  
ished.  
With the exception of two er three  
casualties in remote portions of the  
city this ended the really riotous scenes  
of the day.  
The news of the conflict spread  
quickly to neigh boring cities and large  
bodies of men arrived during the after¬≠  
noon from Fayetteville and other nearby  
towns, and all sections of the city in¬≠  
habited by white people arc closely  
guarded tonight.--State

The committee of 2i) men representing  
the mass meeting of white citizens  
in the execution of the provisions of  
the resolutions adopted Wednesday, demanding  
the departure of Editor Manly  
n &#x27; - &quot;J 1 _c rru~  
  
irom trie city ana cue reiuuvax ui jluc  
Record plant, were to have received a  
definite answer to their demands from  
representative-Negroes at 7.30 a.m.,  
Thursday morning. Chairman A. M.  
Waddell was to report the answer to the  
  
white citizens- in Iront o* tne Wilmington  
Light infantry armory at 8  
o&#x27;clock.  
At the appointed hour more than 500 &#x27;  
determined white citizens, consisting  
of merchants, lawyers, preachers, doctors,  
etc., well armed with guns and ,  
le vol vers, gathered at the armory, and .  
Col. Waddell reported that he had re- ,  
ceived no answer from the negroes. J  
ATT rpQi f of fKn nnfil olm^Qt  
  
9 o&#x27;clock, hoping that an answer complying  
with their demands would be received,  
but none came. The men then  
formed in line, four abreast, and started  
on the march tc the Record, office, in a  
thickly populated negro settlement. As  
the long column of armed men approach  
ed the vieinity great crowds of Negroes,  
men, women and children, were fleeing  
this way and that in a perfect frenzy,  
and very soon, scarcely one was insight  
anywhere. When the column reached  
the building, a two-story frame structure,  
the men were halted, aad several  
advanced to the door. It was locked.  
A few blows by stalwart men forced it  
  
open, about 20 citizens entered, and  
within a very few minutes the whole j  
plant was wrecked, and the broken  
pieces pitched into the street. The ?  
windows of the house were broken out. ^  
As the numerous fragments were tossed g  
into the street, and tne people recog- t  
nized what they were, exultant shouts ^  
went up. Yet with it all there was a t  
remarkable demonstration of coolness ^  
and determination. It was when a  
long sign, l,The Record Publishing  
Uo.,&quot; was cast into the street, that the a  
greatest outburst of cheers went up. A ^  
beaver hat was thrown out and quickly j  
torn in pieces, as was a life bust crayon  
likeness of editor Manly. When the  
wrecking was about complete it became  
evident that the building was on lire. Smoke  
was rising out of the upper  
windows. There were shouts of indig- r  
nation and commands to extinguish the  
flames. But the fire spread quickly, so  
that the fire department had to be called  
out. As the engines and hose reels  
dashed upon the scene, several rounds r  
were fired by the men who were lined

say. Tlie department quickly had the r  
fire under comrul?but not before the c  
building was a total wreck?and prevented  
the spread of the flames to adjacent  
buildings. Conservative men very  
much regret the fire, not only because n  
it was entirely unnecessary, but because  
it endangered a great deal of other- property  
as well. Close on one side of the  
building was St. Stephen&#x27;s church, the .  
largest and handsomest Negro church  
in the city. On the other side, with  
only three or four small cottages, join- *  
ed closely together, between it and the i  
burning building is Ruth hall, a large  
and well equipped hall owned and used  
by Negroes. Happily not a single one ?  
of the adjacent buildings were injured.  
As soon as it was apparent that the fire ?  
was under control, the people left the c  
scene and dispersed through the city, ?  
^ - * 1 3 .i t  
  
many ortnem going on guard amy on their  
various blocks. ^ \
All w+.j quiet until wild rumors, with a  
no foundation in fact, were carried to c  
the Negroes, more than 500, ai work in r  
the cotton compress. They were told B  
that their homes were being burned, c  
etc. They rushed pell mell from their v  
work. However, by the heroic efforts ?  
of Messrs. James and W. H. Sprunt, E  
the proprietors of Alexander Sprunt &amp; E  
Sons Co., the great majority of them B  
were stopped, and finally so controlled j,  
as to leave for their home in small v  
squads. t  
About the time the trouble at the f  
compress was gotten under control, I  
news came from the first ward, over a  
the railroad, that a riot was in progress r  
there. Large numbers of armed men i  
boarded the street car or ran on foot to  
the scene, corner of Fourth and Harnett  
streets.  
This was about 11:30 o&#x27;clock. When 3  
they reached the^ scene five Negroes had *  
already been killed and fully 20 wounded;  
one highly esteemed young white 9  
man, Mr. William Mayo, was seriously ^  
wounded and two others, George Finer 1  
  
and a Mr. Chadwlck, were sligutiy ^  
wounded.  
What gave rise to tHe trouble was  
that white guards who were on duty 1  
on the corner of Fourth and Harnett  
streets,&#x27; halted a squad of Negroes who .  
manifested a threatening a;.r. All of j  
them save one heeded the advice of v  
the guards to disperse. He finally ,  
turned as though to move away and .  
suddenly wheeled about and fired at the v  
squad of guards. Very quickly several t  
rifle balls crashed through his body, j  
killing him instantly. The ball firea j  
by the Negro took effect in Wm. Piner&#x27;s &amp;  
arm. The Negroes in sight quickly .  
i.i i i - n S  
  
aartea arouna corners, ana in a lew moments  
one of them raised up from behind  
a fence and fired a &quot;Winchester  
rifle, severely wounding Wm. Mayo, r  
now of Yonkers, N. Y., who was stand- J&quot;  
ing on the piazza of his father&#x27;s residence.  
Mr. Mayo was here to vote and ?  
would have returned home in a few .  
days. The Negro was captured. He ^  
was in his own yard and two Winches- ,  
ters were found in his house. Within  
10 minutes his body was riddled with v  
bullets. A large mob of Negroes as- e  
sembled about a square away, and rein- ?  
forcements for the white men having ,  
?j it ? j i-i. a  
  
arnveu. a volley was ureu. upuu tucm  
killing four more and wounding others. ?  
The Negroes quickly retreated. The 1  
Wilmington Light infantry and the  
naval reserves vrere called out and the  
rapid-fire gun and the Hotchkiss one- c  
pounder were also hurriedly carried to t  
the scene. A mob of several hundred p  
Negroes was gathered on Ninth street, s  
corner of Nixon, but as the military ad- \
vanced the Negroes fell back and rapid- s  
ly scattered. u  
  
When nearSixtti and iNixon streets a  
shot was fired into the naval reserves  
from a Negro house. A volley of bullets  
was fired by the military through t  
doors and windows, killing one Negro. 11  
Nine inmates were captured and es- e  
corted to jail. The house was demol- fc  
ished. $  
With the exception of two or three t:  
  
casualties in remote portions of the  
city this ended the really riotous scenes  
of the day.  
The news of the conflict spread ?  
quickly to neighboring cities and large j3  
bodies of men arrived during the after- *  
noon from Fayetteville and other nearby *  
towns, and all sections of the city in- *  
  
habited by white people are closely 1  
guarded tonight?State.

Wilmington, N. C. (Special.)‚ÄîThursday  
was a turbulent day Indeed In Wilmington.  
Eace war and revolution held high carni¬≠  
val. Early In the morning a tody ol fully  
1,000 representative white men destroyed  
the office, building, and plant of the negro  
dally, the Record, and would have lynched  
the editor, had It not been that the latter  
had previously left the city. A few hours  
later a fight arose between white guards, by  
whom every block Inhabited by white peo¬≠  
ple was being patrolled, and a mob of sev¬≠  
eral hundred negroes. Six negroes were  
killed and several white men wounded.  
Mayor S. P. Wright, Chief of Police J. C.  
Melton, and the Board of Aldermen, became  
terrorized and resigned. Under the direct¬≠  
ion of a citizens‚Äô committee successors were  
elected, so that now ex-Congressman A. M.  
Waddell is Mayor, Edgar G. Parmalee  
Chief of Police, and a new Board of Aider¬≠  
men has assumed the reins of government.  
Peace and order have been restored, and  
500 special policemen many mounted, and  
on bicycles, nre patrolling the streets. About  
500 armed citizens and military from Fayet¬≠  
teville, Kinston, Goldsboro, and elsewhere,  
are here to help maintain order.  
The committee of twenty-five men repre¬≠  
senting the mass-meetiug of white citizens  
in the execution of the provisions of the res¬≠  
olutions adopted Wednesday, demanding  
the departure of Editor Manly from the  
city and the removal of the Record plant,  
was to have received a definite answer to  
their demands by representative negroes at  
7.80 n. m. Thursday. Chairman A. M. Wad¬≠  
dell was to report the answer to the white  
citizens in front of the Wilmington Light In¬≠  
fantry Armory at 8 o‚Äôclock.  
Wrecked a Newspaper Plant.  
At the appointed hour more than 500 De¬≠  
termined white citizens, comprising mer¬≠  
chants, lawyers, preachers, dootors, Ac.,  
well armed with guns and revolvers,  
gathered at the corner and Col. Waddle re¬≠  
ported that he had received no answer from  
the negroes. They waited at the armory un¬≠  
til almost 9 o‚Äôclook hoping that an answer  
complying with their demand would be re¬≠  
ceived, but none came.  
The men formed In line, four abreast, and  
started on the march to the Record office in  
a thickly-populated negro settlement. As  
the long column of armed men approachod  
the vicinity, great crowds of negioes, men,  
womeD, and children, fled this way and that  
in a perfect frenzy, and very soon scarcely  
one was in sight anywhere.  
When the column reached the buildlDg, a  
two-story frame structure, the men were  
baited, and several advanced to the door.  
It was looked. A few blows by stalwart  
men forced it open, and about twenty peo¬≠  
ple entered. Within a very few minutes th.&#x27;,  
whole plant was wreckod, and the broken  
pieces pitched into the street. The windows  
of the house were broken out. As the num¬≠  
erous fragments were tossed into the street,  
and the people recognized what they were,  
exultant shouts went up. Yet with it all  
there was a remarkable demonstration of  
coolness and determination. It was when a  
long sign, the Record Publishing Company,  
was cast into the street, that the greatest  
outburst of cheers went up. A beaver hat  
was thrown out and quickly torn in pieces,  
as was a crayon likenoss of Editor Manlly.  
Building Set Afire and Burned.  
When the wrecking was about complete  
it became evident that the building was on  
Are. Smoke was rising out of the upper  
windows. There were shouts of indignation  
and commands to extinguish the flames.  
But the fire spread quickly, so that the Are  
‚ñ†department had to be called out. As the  
engines and hose reels dashed upon the  
scene, several rounds were llred by the men  
who were lined up for more than two  
squares either way. The department quick¬≠  
ly had the fire under control, hut not be¬≠  
fore the building was a total wreck, and  
prevented the spread of the flames to adja¬≠  
cent buildings.

necessary, but because it endangered a great  
deal of .other property as well.  
As soon as it was apparent that the Are&#x27;  
was under control the people left the scene  
and dispersed through the oity, many of  
them going on guard duty on their various  
blocks. All was quiet until wild rumors,  
with no foundation in fact, were carried to  
the negroes, more than 500 of whom were at  
work in the cotton compress. They were  
told that their homes were being burned  
out. They rushed pell mell from their  
work. However, by the heroic efforts of  
Messrs. James and W. H. Sprunt, the pro¬≠  
prietors of Alexander Sprunt &amp; Son Com¬≠  
pany, the great majority of them were  
stopped and Anally Induced to leave for  
their homes in small squads.  
Fatal ltioting In the First Ward.  
About the time the trouble at the oom¬≠  
press was gotten under control, news oame  
from the First Ward, over the railroad, that  
a riot was in progress there. Large num¬≠  
bers of armed men boarded the street car  
or ran on foot to the scene, corner of Fourth  
and Harnett streets.  
It was about 11.SO o‚Äôolock when they  
reached the scene. Four negroes had al¬≠  
ready been killed and fully twenty wounded.  
One highly esteemed young wbite man,  
William Mayo, waa seriously wounded, and  
two others, George Finer und a Mr. Chad¬≠  
wick, were sllghly wounded. What gave  
rise to the trouble was that white guards,  
who were on duty on the corner of Fourth

negroes who manifested a threatening air.  
All of them save one heeded the advice of

about and flrod at tbe squad of guardsj  
Very quickly several rifle balls crashed  
through his body, kiying him Instantly. !

corners, and in a few moments one of them  
fired a Winchester rifle from behind a fence,  
seriously wounding William Mayo, now of  
Yonkers, N. Y., who was standing on the  
piazza of his father‚Äôs residence. Mr. Mayo  
was here to vote and would have returned  
home In a few days. The negro was cap¬≠  
tured. He was in his own yurd and two  
Winchesters were found in his house  
Within ten minutes his body was riddled  
with bullets.  
Mob Fired on and Four Killed.  
A large mob of negroes assembled about a  
square away, and re-enforcements for the  
white men having arrived, a volley was fired  
upon them, killing four and wounding oth¬≠  
ers. The negroes then quickly retreated.  
The Wilmington Light Infantry and the  
Naval Reserves were called out and the  
rapid-fire gun and Hotchkiss one-pounder  
were also hurriedly carried to the scene. A  
mob of sevoral hundred negroes gathered  
on Ninth street, corner of Nixon, but as the  
military advanced the negroes fell back and  
rapidly scattered. When near Sixth and  
Nixon streets a shot was Bred into the Naval  
Reserves from a negro‚Äôs house. A volley of  
bullets was fired by the military through  
doors and windows, killing one negro. Six  
more Inmates were captured and esoorted  
to jail and the house demolished.  
With the exception of two or three casual¬≠  
Ities in remote portions of the city this  
ended the really riotous scenes of the day.  
The news of the conflict spread quickly to  
neighboring cities and large bodies of men  
arrived during the afternoon from Fayette¬≠  
ville and other nearby towns. All sections  
of the city inhabited by white people are  
closely guarded.

‚ÄúSo far as recallsd no Governor of a!  
State in this country has ever lost his  
life at the hands of indignant, citizens  
of his Commonwealth. But Governor  
Daniel L. Russell, of North Carolina,  
came very near suffering it from mob  
rule when the excitement was. in its  
height and while the streets of Wil¬≠  
mington were literally running with  
blood.  
‚ÄúGovernor Russell began bis political;  
career as a leader in this section of tin}  
State. lie organized tlu* colored Repub¬≠  
licans in Wilmington, and more than  
any other one man is responsible for tin*  
ascendancy of tin* African over tint!  
white man in tlu* Cape Fear region. So  
when tlu* negroes were shooting at tin*  
white citizens and the white eitiz us were j  
actually potting the negroes by dozens!  
with Winchesters, Springtieids and sliotr j  
guns tlu* Governor, who was in this  
section of North. Carolina, hearing of  
the trouble, started for home.  
‚ÄúHe first intended going byway of  
Goldsboro. Learning that there was a  
mob of several hundred men at Golds¬≠  
boro waiting to give him a reception,  
ami knowing that it that period of ex¬≠  
citement he was a marked man. lie  
changed bis route and went via Max¬≠  
loo. Word got to Maxton ahead of the  
Governor that he was going that way,  
and when tlu* triiii arrived a swearing,  
howling mob of ‚Äúred whirls,‚Äù heavily  
armed and ready for almost anything,  
was awaiting him.  
‚ÄúThey invaded the car. threatened tin*  
Governor and actually offered him vio¬≠  
lence. ‚ÄôPin* crowd was &#x27;increasing and  
there were cries of ‚ÄòLynch him!‚Äô when  
tlu* Governor and one of bis friends  
hust.ed out of the car into a box ear,  
w Deli was locked behind him, and tlu*  
conductor and his friends stood guard  
until the train pulled out.  
‚ÄúGovernor Russell reached Id*- &#x27; *me.  
in Raleigh, over the Sealtoard Air Line  
very badly frightened, and the Gover¬≠  
nor&#x27;s friend did not have a button on  
bis coat and bis raiment was iu tatters.  
The Governor weighs more than three  
hundred pounds, and his frustrated ene¬≠

to the figure he would have cut at the

Oregonlan. . &quot; : (  
The endowment of the blacks with  
ihe full right of suffrage was the great¬≠  
est mistake ever made in our political  
history. It has only brought trouble  
to them and increased beyond measure  
the political difficulties ot tbe country.  
Since the error is now seen in its re¬≠  
sults, it may as well be frankly con¬≠  
fessed. It mocks the negroes with be¬≠  
stowal of a franchise which the masses  
of tbem will not be perm i ted to exer¬≠  
cise, and, in fact, are unfit to exercise,  
and brings on a race war in which they  
will In every case be trodden down.  
Since tbis Is the demonstrated result,  
there is no need to deceive ourselves  
about it. Abstention of the blacks  
from politics, and in particular from  
combinations to elect persons of their  
own race to office, is necessary alike for  
their safety and for the public peace;  
for tbe whites will not submit to negro

Race Riots and Shotgun Law in the Carolinas  
  
Bk:ks a-d Whites Arrayed Against Each Other in Murderous Fury. The Governor of One State Barely Escapes Death From the Mob. Men and Incidents in the Frightful Outbreak of Race Hatred That Has Deluged Two States in Blood  
and Shocked the Nation.  
  
Special Correspondence of the Sunday Call  
WILMINGTON, N. C. Nov. 19.  
‚ÄîThe Governor of South  
Carolina, he says to the  
Governor of North Caro¬≠  
lina, &quot;It&#x27;s a long time be¬≠  
tween lynchings&quot;: and the Governor of  
North Carolina, he says to the Gover¬≠  
nor of Sou h Carolina, &quot;Sh-h! Don&#x27;t  
talk to me about lynchings. Golly!  
Don&#x27;t you know they came near lynch¬≠  
ing me the other night?&quot;  
Thus in allegory they are telling  
through this Southern country of an in¬≠  
cident in the race war of last week  
which somehow did not get into the  
papers, but came very near furnishing j  
a.s big a sensation as North Carolina j  
ever had in its history. So far as re¬≠  
called no Governor of a State in this  
..country has ever lost his life at the  
hands of indignant citizens of his com¬≠  
monwealth.  
But Governor Daniel L. Russell of  
North Carolina came very near suffer¬≠  
ing it from mob rule when the excite¬≠  
ment was at its luight and while the  
streets o&#x27; Wilmington were literally  
running with blood.  
Governor Russell began his political  
career as a leader in this section of the  
He organized the colored Re¬≠  
publicans in Wilmington, and more  
than any other one man is responsible  
for the ascendency of the African over  
the white man in the Cape Fear region.  
So when the negi &gt;es were shooting at  
the white citizens and the white citi¬≠  
zens were actually potting the negroes  
by dozens with Winchesters, Spring¬≠  
fields and shotguns, the Governor, who  
was in this section of North Carolina,  
hearing of the trouble, started for  
home.  
MLYNCH THE GOVERNOR.&quot;  
He first intended going by way of  
Goldsboro. Learning that there was a  
mob of several hundred men at Go&#x27;.ds¬≠  
boro waiting to give him a reception,  
and knowing that at that period of  
excitement he was a marked man, he  
changed his route and went via Max¬≠  
ton. Word got to Maxton ahead of the  
Governor that he was going that way,  
and when the train arrived a swearing,  
howling mob of &quot;red shirts,&quot; heavily  
armed and ready for almost anything,  
was awaiting him.  
They invaded the car, threatened the  
Governor and actually offered him vio¬≠  
lence. The crowd was increasing and  
there were cries of &quot;Lynch him:&quot; when  
the Governor and one of his friends  
hustled out of the car into a box car,  
which was locked behind him, and the  
conductor and his friends stood guard  
until the train pulled out.  
Governor Russell reached his home, in  
Raleigh, over the Seaboard Air Line,  
very badly frightened, and the Govern¬≠  
or&#x27;s friend did not have a button on  
his coat and his raiment was in tat¬≠  
ters. The Governor weighs more than  
300 pounds and his frustrated enemies  
at Maxton are still speculating as to  
the figure he would have cut at the  
end of a rope.  
This is only one incident of the many  
‚Ä¢ exciting events that have stirred the  
two Carolinas during the last ten days.  
There has been a great political riot  
and a wholesale massacre of negroes in  
Wilmington, N. C. There has been a  
great political riot and a wholesale  
sacre of negroes in Greenwood, S.  
:C. Th¬ª- story of Wilmington and the  
story of Greenwood both furnish food  
for thought, but on &#x27;tr different lines.  
THP WILMINGTON RIOT.  
At Wilmington at least fifteen ne¬≠  
groes were killed,- but no white man  
lost his life. At Greenwood at least  
‚Ç¨-ight negroes were killed and one white  
man lost his !if&lt;&#x27;.  
I will first teil the story of Wilming¬≠  
ton and then of Greenwood, and lot the  
&quot;impartial reader draw his own conclu¬≠  
sions and make his own comparisons.  
The Wilmington riot was due entirely  
‚ñ†to th&lt;- negro attaining supremacy in lo¬≠  
cal politics. North Carolina Is about  
Th&gt;- &quot;nly Southern State in which the  
negro has practically without restric¬≠  
tion exercised the right of .-tuffrage. The  
negroes have b&lt; en permitted to do this  
..because they were in the minority.  
‚Ä¢: There are 210,000 white voters in the  
State and about 100,000 colored voters.  
Only in recent years did the danger of  
;&#x27; the negro securing supremacy become  
threatening. Tri 1898, whf-n a combina¬≠  
tion Of the black and white Republi¬≠  
. cans and th&lt; Populists mad&quot; Russell  
¬Ñ;nvnrnor by an enormous majority, the  
white voters, and especially the Demo¬≠  
cratic white voters, began to have their  
apprehensions.  
Governor Russell hails from the sec¬≠  
tion of the State in which Wilmington  
ils situated. Here the ratio of colored  
men to. white is almost two to one. The  
Governor and his Republican allies got  
: hold of the government of the city of  
Wilmington, and in order to keep the  
&#x27;..negroes solid permitted them to share  
in the offices. The colored men here  
quickly felt their power. They realized  
that it was through their votes that  
the Republicans had triumphed. While  
the Republican leaders held the more  
‚Ä¢ important offices the white men in  
:Wilmington soon found that they had  
‚Ä¢ over them a colored police force, while  
‚Ä¢the fire department largely consisted of  
colored men and the postoffice was  
. manned with colored letter-carriers.  
A NEGRO GOVERNMENT.  
In fact to all intents and purposes, it  
was a colored city government. The  
colored city government levied the  
city taxes, collected them and spent]  
  
them The whites were paying 96Mi  
per cent of the taxes, the colored were  
paving 3Va per cent of the taxes.  
Following the induction into office of  
this new regime came a repetition or  
the old story of profligacy and an abuse  
erf power. Nearly every Southern city  
in the days of reconstruction had been  
through it, and now it was Wilming¬≠  
ton&#x27;s turn. The colored men did not  
make good policemen. They neglected  
their posts and robberies multiplied.  
Women were insulted on the street and  
there was no redress. White women  
would be jostled from the sidewalks  
into the muddy streets by ‚Ñ¢lored  
women and negro men would laugh at  
them. Little white girls would have  
their hats snatched and thrown into  
the roadway and assaults of negroes  
upon whites were of constant occur¬≠  
rence. Property was insecure and in¬≠  
surance rates advanced. ‚Äû¬´!¬´,,,  
Even Mr. Chadbourn, the Republican  
Postmaster, wrote and published a let¬≠  
ter in which he declared that the ne¬≠  
groes were in charge of the municipal  
government of Wilmington; that the  
whites would not longer ar *ith thib  
condition of affairs, and that they  
would carry the next election either  
with votes or with arms.  
Long before the canvass in the cam¬≠  
paign just closed began the white citi¬≠  
zens of Wilmington, almost without re¬≠  
gard to party, prepared for the great  
Ist emergency. Six months ago they  
be?an to arm themselves quietly. Each  
white citizen not affiliated with the Re¬≠  
publican reign, if he did not already  
have a serviceable firearm, purchased  
a Winchester or a Springfield rifle and  
lots of ammunition. They determined  
to carry the fall election by force and  
intimidation if they could not carry it  
any other way.  
GOVERNOR RUSSELL ALARMED.  
They made no concealment of thi¬£;  
determination before the election; they  
make no concealment of it now. They  
were firmly convinced that the African  
was not born to rule the white man.  
and no amount of argument can change |  
tl\e;lovernolr¬∞Russell1overnolr¬∞Russell became alarmed at  
the threatening condition of affairs that  
his management had brought about.  
He was notified that something dread¬≠  
ful would happen in Wilmington if the  
negroes attempted to outvote the  
whites on election clay, and through his  
influence the Republican leader8 were  
forced lust before the election, to take  
down their ticket and give the Demo¬≠  
crats no opposition in the- county ex¬≠  
cept one Representative in Congress and  
State Senator, these districts including  
other counties than New Hanover, in  
which Wilmington is situated.  
Election day passed off quietly in  
Wilmmgton, although in three or four  
other counties in the State the negroes  
were SSKildated and hindered from  
voting by the presence of armed men at  
thThe¬∞eiection &#x27;eing over the whites de¬≠  
termined to put out of office the entire  
o?t‚Ñ¢ government, by force if necessary.  
The Governor tried to induce the city  
officials to resign, but without avail.  
Then an orderly meeting of the white  
citizens was called, and resolutions  
were passed taking possession of the  
city government in the interest of the  
white population, calling on Alexander  
Manly the colored editor of the Repub¬≠  
lican paper, to leave town, and appoint¬≠  
ing a committee to wait on the more  
objectionable white officeholders and  
colored leaders and invite them to leave  
the county.  
WHITE NAN KILLED FIRST.  
The story of the exciting events that  
full-,wed this revolution have already  
been told. Manly, the colored editor,  
who had been an object of loathing for  
month? because of the editorial attack¬≠  
ing white women, had already taken his  
departure. The Record office was  
burned, because the proprietors of the  
paper were believed by the committee  
appointed at the mass meeting to be ig¬≠  
noring its demand.  
An outbreak on the part of the ne¬≠  
ernes hnd been expected that day, and  
nearly every white man in the city of  
Wilmington was under arms. This  
number has been estimated at 2000. The  
white citizens f&gt;f each block had a dis¬≠  
tinct organization undrr a separate  
leader. TCach man had his orders, and  
no matter where disorder broke out the  
white citizens were prepared to quell  
it quickly or add to It materially.  
There is no question ihnt the first  
shooting was done by th¬∞ black men.  
A negro in Brooklyn, a suburb, phot a  
white man through the tight arm. The  
wounded man with his left hnnd shot  
the npgm dead. The negroes began to  
rally in force with guns, and four of  
them were shot dead in their tracks  
then and there. The blacks were over¬≠  
awed but not before at least fifteen  
had been killed and probably twice as  
many wounded. One negro was found  
badly wounded hiding beneath a porcn  
and was taken to the hospital.  
It was a rei^n of terror simply for  
the blacks and their white associates.  
A REIGN OF TERROR.  
A committee moved quickly around  
and notified the more prominent and  
objectionable white Republicans that  
they must leave town. Silas P. Wright,  
the Mayor, had already gone. Justice  
of the &quot;Peace Bunting, who was also  
United States Commissioner, was told  
to go&#x27; So were Chief of Police Melton  
and Charles Gilbert, the superintendent  
of city carts. Notice was also served  
on G. Z. French. Mr. French is th*  
acting, sheriff. He allowed the actual

the duties of the office himself and took  
all the emoluments.  
Pictures of Bunting and his colored |  
housekeeper still hang on a tree in  
front of his house, where they were  
hung by the mob. Thomas Miller, a  
noted colored leader, who, when he  
heard the Record building had been  
burned, declared that he would wash  
his hands in white men&#x27;s blood that  
night, was lodged in jail, and a picket  
was thrown around to prevent the  
more irresponsible whites from drag¬≠  
ging him forth and killing him.  
Colonel Waddell, one of the most  
prjminent citizens, who had been chair¬≠  
man of the mass meeting, was elected  
Mayor, and all the old officials resigned  
under pressure. Waddell has a fighter&#x27;s  
jaw. His ancestors have fought in three  
\&gt; ars.  
Dr. Silas P. Wright offered his resig¬≠  
nation as Mayor of the city, and it was  
accepted. Colonel A. M. Waddell was  
elected Mayor of the city and sworn in  
by M. Newman, J. P., &#x27;whereupon Mr.  
Wad Jell took his seat as Mayor.  
Nearly all of the old city officials aro  
now in Washington seeking to have a  
Congressional investigation or aro wan¬≠  
dering northward seeking new places  
of abode.  
The statement telegraphed North that  
ministers of the Gospel, with rifles on  
their shoulders, paraded the streets on  
Thursday and Friday nights to pre¬≠  
serve order is no fiction. This actually  
took place. It is also a fact that the  
race question in Wilmington rose above  
politics, and that many white men  
heretofore Republicans joined in over¬≠  
turning the city government.  
The fury of the mob at Wilmington  
when it finally burst forth was added to  
by race prejudice, long kept in restraint  
in North Carolina. The deepest blot on  
the city is that the poor whites wan¬≠  
tonly shot any negroes they met. Most  
of the murdered victims were unarmed  
and molesting no one.  
So high did the feeling in Wilming¬≠  
ton run during the political campaign  
that it is a marvel that there was not  
a murderous outbreak long before  
Thursday, November 10.  
Early in the campaign Governor Rus¬≠  
sell became a target far the orators  
of the white men&#x27;s party. The Gov¬≠  
ernor owns a large plantation on the  
other side of Cape Fear River, just op¬≠  
posite Wilmington. For years he has  
supplied the city with milk. Some one  
printed a communication in the Mes¬≠  
senger one day inquiring why white  
men bought Governor Russell&#x27;s milk,  
since he was responsible for negro rule  
in the city.  
Instantly the Governor&#x27;s dairy was  
boycotted and his milk is not now sold  
in the city.  
So much for the story of the riot in  
Wilmington. Now for the story of  
Greenwood

<table style="width: 100%;"><tr><td style="width: 50%">

  
  
From the Shores of the Faelflc  
  
After recounting the conditions an  
tecedent to the 10th of November, the  
Oregonian of Portland, Oregon, speaks  
sensibly as follows:  
The recital of the facts of this anti  
negro cnisade in North Carolina is es¬≠  
sential to full understanding of the  
situation, and to fair consideration of  
the appeal made by our colored people  
and by some of the leading republi  
can newspapers of the east for the In¬≠  
terference of the president. In our  
Judgment, nothing can be done to re  
lieve the situation of the south through  
invoking the interference of the fed¬≠  
eral government. The governor of  
North Carolina is a republican elected  
by the vote of the negroes; he did not  
interfere; he made no call upon the  
preisdent. The governor of South  
Carolina did not interfere nor make  
any call for federal interference. Un¬≠  
der their state governments, these  
revolutionists and rioters will not be  
punished; it does not appear that in  
the overthrow of the municipal govern¬≠  
ment at Wilmington, or in the race  
riot at Greenwood, any federal law was  
attacked or obstructed, or any United  
States officials were resisted in the  
exercise of their duties.  
The president would probably find it  
difficult to obtain legal ground for in¬≠  
terference, but, even if he could inter¬≠  
fere legally in the municipal elections,  
like that at Wilmington, he could not  
interfere effectively. It was a repub¬≠  
lican congress that refused to give  
Grant a force in 1S74, without which  
he confessed he could not interfere ef¬≠  
fectively to suppress such outrages as  
those in the Carolinas. If the ruling  
forces of the public opinion in North  
Carolina are so strongly white that a  
republican governor elected largely by j  
negro votes dares not interfere; if, as  
we have proved over and over again  
during twenty years, no local juries  
will convict any man put on trial for  
acts of rack violence, of what conse¬≠  
quence would be the investigation of  
a federal attorney general, or the arrest  
and trial of the leading rioters? When  
we had the south under bayonet rule,  
it was not easy to identify, try and con¬≠  
vict a kluklux assassin, and since the  
end of bayonet rule it has been impos¬≠  
sible.The situation at the south is deplor¬≠  
able, but it is, we believe, incurable  
through any outside interference. If  
there was any danger that Presi  
dent McKinley could or would interfere  
to upset the uprising municipal gov¬≠  
ernment of Wilmington tomorrow,  
there would be a civil war. The Co¬≠  
lumbia, (S. C.) State Journal says that,  
if the North Carolina negroes should  
&quot;force a war, the whites of South  
Carolina would cross the line to help  
their white brethren.&quot; The Richmond  
Times adds that the Virginia whites  
would do the same, for &quot;blood is  
thicker than water.&quot; A mob assaulted  
and nearly killed a negro in the Nor¬≠  
folk, Va., postoffice, who called for mail  
for &quot;Editor Manly,&quot; whose paper was  
destroyed in the Wilmington riot.  
The situation at the south is one that  
must be met as a condition as best we  
can. It cannot &quot;be solved by the theo¬≠  
retical expectation of equal legal jus¬≠  
tice which is generally enforced and  
obtained at the north. No president  
can arrest, no government can indict,  
try, convict and punish a whole people;  
and that is what would be necessary  
to punish the acts of violence and rev¬≠  
olution that have recently been com¬≠  
mitted in the Carolinas and Mississip¬≠  
pi. Nobody can solve the negro prob¬≠  
lem; nobody can settle the race war  
at the south, if the state governments  
and the ruling forces of public opin¬≠  
ion in these states are not equal to its  
solution. The negro must accept the  
best terms he can get from the ruling  
white public opinion, not because it  
is equal justice, but because he cannot  
help himself. President McKinley is  
powerless to interfere, and if he were  
not powerless his interference would  
only start a storm of resistance which  
could not be overcome. The whites,  
whether in the minority or not, will  
be sure to rule at the south, by right  
if possible, by might if necessary.  
What Grant could not maintain by  
bayonet rule cannot be undone or re  
dressed by McKinley with a marshal  
and a federal judge. In localities  
where the negroes are few there will  
be little difficulty. But in localities  
where they are numerous they will not  
be permitted the exercise of political  
rights, for the result would result in  
negro government. The endowment  
of the blacks with the full right of  
suffrage was the greatest mistake ever  
made in our political history. It has  
only brought trouble to them and in  
creased beyond measure the political  
difficulties cf the country. Since the  
error is row seen in its results, it may  
as well be frankly confessed. It  
mocks the negroes with bestowal of a  
franchise which the masse of them will  
not be permitted to exercise, and, in  
fact, are unfit to exercise, and brings  
on a race war in which they will in  
every case be trodden down. Since  
this is the demonstrated result, there  
is no ned to deceive ourselves about it.  
Abstention of the blacks from politics,  
and in particular from combinations  
to elect person of their own races to  
office, is necessary alike for their  
safety and for the public peace; for  
the whites will not submit to negro  
government.

Xhe Wilmington Blot flatter  
TrtSfJ&quot; f 7  
E7er since Governor Russell&#x27;s visit  
here there nave been rumors current  
in the inner North Carolina circle that  
a deal is on foot whereby Ewart Is to  
be defeated in the senate for judge of  
1 the western district. Senator Pritchard  
to be appointed in his place and V. S.  
Teif fr be najnPfl AS senator DV UOV-  
ernor Russell to succeed Pritchard.  
Thi3 same rumor was current last win¬≠  
ter, but proved to be at that time un¬≠  
founded. It appears now with a sem¬≠  
blance of substance at least to it, but  
whether it Is well founded future devel¬≠  
opments alone can determine.  
It is certain now that Governor Rus¬≠  
sell is opposed to the confirmation of  
Judge Ewart. He covered his tracks so  
well while here that at first he was be¬≠  
leived to have interested himself in  
Ewart&#x27;s behalf. Senator Pritchard was  
led to so believe, but after the gover¬≠  
nor&#x27;s departure, he became possessed  
of information to the contrary. Sena¬≠  
tor Pritchard still favors Ewart, but  
the best legal minds in the senate are  
opposed to him and Senator Butler will  
leave no stone unturned to defeat him.  
It is well known here that Pritchard  
would not decline a life position such  
as Is the place of judge of the western  
district of North Carolina. At the  
same time, Pritchard does not wish to  
be placed in a position of being even by  
inference, opposed to Ewart, and he  
frowns upon all suggestions in that di¬≠  
rections .Yet if Ewart if defeated  
Pritchard&#x27;s is the name that is likely  
t t tn presiaent as an acCept-  
. - . v  
able one. It is said that Governor Rus  
sell suggested him to the president.  
Then too Pritchard would meet with  
almost instant confirmation. Senato¬≠  
rial courtesy alone would insure that. It  
is also pointed out that in the next sen¬≠  
ate, with a heavy republican majority,  
Pritchard&#x27;s vote would not be needed  
by the republicans. Butler would not  
oppose Pritchard. In fact they have of  
ate been getting closer together than  
heretofore. Pritchard&#x27;s days, demo  
crats assert, are numbered in North  
Carolina, and beyond his present term  
as senator he would have no polit  
ical future. As judge he would have  
a life position. Then too, it is said  
hat Butler would angle for Pritchard&#x27;s  
help, in consideration of Butler&#x27;s al¬≠  
lowing Pritchard&#x27;s confirmation. This  
would leave the road clear for Russell  
to reward Mr. Lusk, a friend of Pritch¬≠  
ard as well as himself, by appointing  
himsenator. All this suggests the for¬≠  
mation of a Pritchard-Butler-Russell  
combine, and the ground indications,  
at present, look that way.  
ALL LOOKS TO SIMMONS.  
Among democrats here no other name  
is heard as the next senator from North  
Carolina except that of Chairman Sim  
mons. His record while in congress  
was excellent, and among the older  
members, both of the house and the  
senate, he is remembered most pleas¬≠  
antly. It is not believed among demo  
crats that any combination can be  
found among the populist-republicans  
that can prevent the democrats from  
controlling the next legislature.  
WILMINGTON RIOT CASES.  
The department of justice does not  
seem to be concerning itself much over  
the Wilmington riot cases. The direct  
prosecution of these cases has been  
placed in the hands of District Attor  
ney Bernard. Regarding the detail of  
witnesses summoned before the grand  
jury, etc., the department of justice pro  
fesses ignorance.  
&quot;The presumption is that officials will  
do their duty, is it not?&quot; suggested The  
Post correspondent to Assistant Attor  
ney General Boyd, referring to the fail  
ure of Mr. Bernard to have essential  
witnesses before the Raleigh grand  
jury.  
&quot;That is the presumption,&quot; he said,  
&quot;but sometimes it is a violent one.&quot; Mr.  
Boyd said that so far as he knew no  
letter from Judge Purnell, &quot;tart or  
otherwise,&quot; regarding the vilmington  
affair, had been received by the depart  
ment of justice.  
Bunting and Melton are all here and  
have been for ten days or more. They  
evidently believes with Congressman  
Kitchin, that his efforts to get indict¬≠  
ments in the Wilmington case would  
be unavailing. Said Kitchin: &quot;No grand  
jury that can be assembled in our state  
will return indictments against any one  
in the Wilmington affair.&quot;  
Congressman Strowd has not been  
here this session.  
White, the negro congressman, ap  
peared in his seat yesterday for the first  
time.  
Only Kitchin and White of the North  
Carolina delegation were present when  
the house adjourned Wednesday for  
-the Christmas holidays, all the others  
having left the day before for home

&quot;These men are indomitable, At  
Bocoor Bridge they waited till the  
Americans brought cannon within  
thirty-five yards of their trenches. Such  
men have a right to be heard. All  
they want is a little justice. I estab¬≠  
lished civil government at Belinag,  
with the government entirely in the  
hands of the natives. It worked to  
perfection. All these people need for  
  
self-government is the protection of  
our troops till affairs have quieted,  
and they will, I have no doubt, ad¬≠  
vance as rapidly as the Japanese ; per¬≠  
haps more rapidly. I am very well  
  
impressed with Filipinos.&quot;  
  
Looks Blue Tor Bernard.  
Washington, Sept. At the Depart  
  
ment of Justice officials are judicious¬≠  
ly reticent about the most recent es  
capade of District Attorney Bernard.  
None will be quoted, and the Attorney  
General is naturally indignant that a  
high official of his department, who is  
  
sworn to uphold the laws, should be  
charged with bringing the department  
  
into disgrace as well as himself.&#x27; Mark  
ed copies of The Morning Post con¬≠  
taining an account of Mr. Shephard at  
Greenville have been sent to theAttorney-General,  
and the general feel¬≠  
ing is that of disgust and shatn e .  
As stated in these dispatches several  
times, the attorney for the Eastern  
District of North Carolina does not  
  
stand very high at the Department of  
  
Justice, and his official tenure has long  
hung by a thread. He would have  
been fired long ago, when his loose  
methods of conducting business was  
the subject of official inquiry, had not  
  
Senator Pritchard put in his saving  
  
oar. Again, his jellyfish conduct of  
  
the case against the Wilmington &#x27;&#x27;riot¬≠  
ers,&quot; so called, showed an utter lack  
of bone in the back.  
What the present course of the pow¬≠  
ers that be, will be towards Mr. Ber¬≠  
nard cannot be definitely asserted.  
It is certain, however, that he will have  
to receive bacsing and support out  
side of Senator Pritchard, who will not  
uphold the invasion of the home circle,  
even by one whose appointment he  
secured. He is not that kind of a man.
